  <div class="entry-content"><p>OpsWorks is a new service from Amazon that promises to provide high-level tools to manage your EC2-based deployment. From <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/02/aws-opsworks-flexible-application-management-in-the-cloud.html">the announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>AWS OpsWorks features an integrated management experience for the entire application lifecycle including resource provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, monitoring, and access control. It will work with applications of any level of complexity and is independent of any particular architectural pattern.</p></blockquote>

<p>After scratching our heads about exactly what that meant, we tried it anyway. If you&#8217;ve been straining at the limits of your Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, or just wishing for more automation for your EC2 deployment, you may want to try it out too.</p>

<p>Artsy has been experimenting with OpsWorks for a few months now and recently adopted it for the production <a href="http://artsy.net">artsy.net</a> site. We&#8217;re excited to share what we&#8217;ve learned in the process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A whopping 49% of Artsy users have &#8220;gmail.com&#8221; email addresses. The next domain name, &#8220;hotmail.com&#8221;, doesn&#8217;t even come close, with only 6%.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2013-06-23-normalizing-gmail-email-addresses-with-canonical-emails/artsy-email-domains.png" /></p>

<p>GMail addresses ignore periods and are case-insensitive. For example, &#8220;Donald.Duck@gmail.com&#8221; and &#8220;donaldduck@gmail.com&#8221; are the same account. You can log-in to GMail with both. Users often register with the former and try to log-in to Artsy with the latter. With so many GMail users, expect a dozen support emails per day.</p>

<p>The solution is to normalize these emails into a canonical form.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Write fast, headless, tests for Backbone using Node.js. See this project as an example  <a href="https://github.com/craigspaeth/backbone-headless-testing">https://github.com/craigspaeth/backbone-headless-testing</a>.</p>

<h2>A Brief History</h2>

<p>Artsy is mostly a thick client <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> app that sits on <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and largely depends on <a href="http://jnicklas.github.io/capybara/">Capybara</a> (<a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> backed bot that clicks around Firefox) for testing it&#8217;s javascript. This leads to some seriously brittle and slow integration tests. <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/02/03/reliably-testing-asynchronous-ui-w-slash-rspec-and-capybara/">Despite being able to wrangle Capybara</a> to do most of our client-side testing, we knew there must be a better way.</p>

<p>When building a CMS app for our gallery partners to manage their Artsy inventory, we built a new Backbone app on top of <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>. The result was a headless test suite that runs around 60 times faster.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at how it&#8217;s done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://artsy.net">artsy.net website</a> is a Backbone.js application that talks to a server-side RESTful Grape API sitting on top of a Rails app which serves minimal HTML markup. The latter includes such things as a page title, along with links to JavaScript and stylesheet packages. A page loads, scripts run, data is fetched from the API. The result is merged into a HAMLJS template and rendered client-side.</p>

<p>Building this kind of one-page apps allows for clean separation between the presentation and API layers. The downside is that it will slow page render times - fetching data after page load means waiting for an AJAX request to complete before displaying anything.</p>

<p>There&#8217;re many solutions to this problem, all involving some kind of server-side rendering. You could, for example, share views and JavaScript between client and server. This would be a major paradigm shift for a large application like ours and not something we could possibly maneuver in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Without changing the entire architecture of the system, how can we bootstrap JSON data server-side and avoid the data roundtrip on every page load?</p>

I&#8217;d like to talk about the third of these.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve experimented with quite a lot of analytics tools for the Artsy website, and it seemed fitting to do the same for our mobile app. We wanted the freedom to change the analytics tool without having to change the code, and so <a href="http://github.com/orta/ARAnalytics">ARAnalytics</a> was born.</p>

<p>What?! <strong>401 Broadway</strong>? See, our office address is <em>401 Broadway, 10013, New York, NY</em>. We just tried to add a more developer-friendly way to find us in the New York grid. And here&#8217;s the view from our 25th floor office - that&#8217;s SOHO right below us and the Empire State Building a bit North.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p> At Artsy we make Artsy Folio. Folio is an awesome portfolio app that shows our gallery and museum partners their artworks in one place, allows them to easily get information about their inventory and to send works by email to their contacts.</p>

<p>Folio has to deal with large multi-gigabyte syncs in order to operate offline. That makes for a great user experience, but for the developer working on the sync, it&#8217;s not as pleasant. Combined with our use of Core Data, the app’s maturity, and dealing with data store migrations, things can get hairy. We needed a tool that could freeze and restore app data at will, obviating the need for constant syncing and resyncing.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I built <a href="https://github.com/orta/chairs">chairs</a>&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://rapgenius.com/James-somers-herokus-ugly-secret-lyrics">Heroku&#8217;s Ugly Secret</a> blog post went viral last week. I <a href="http://code.dblock.org/in-defense-of-heroku">wrote</a> in defense of Heroku, which has now responded with an official <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/2/16/routing_performance_update/">Routing Performance Update</a>.</p>

<p>Random request queuing has been discussed in the past in <a href="http://tiwatson.com/blog/2011-2-17-heroku-no-longer-using-a-global-request-queue">Tim Watson&#8217;s post</a> based on a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!msg/heroku/8eOosLC5nrw/Xy2j7GapebIJ">response</a> by Heroku&#8217;s Adam Wiggins. While the documentation may not have been accurate or even somewhat misleading, we, at Artsy, understood the strategy and the limitations of the routing mesh for quite sometime. Therefore, we have been making continuous efforts to improve our application&#8217;s performance and reduce the negative impact of random routing inside the routing mesh over the past few months.</p>

<p>One thing we didn&#8217;t do, was to measure the actual wait time inside a dyno. In restrospect, it seems obvious that we should have. In this post we&#8217;ll describe a middleware to do so. This is entirely based on the work of <a href="https://gist.github.com/daveyeu/4960893">David Yeu</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/jasonrclark/d82a1ea7695daac0b9ee">Jason R Clark</a> and RG&#8217;s own <a href="https://gist.github.com/a-warner/f5db30857ed3423cea79">Andrew Warner</a>.</p>

<p>With this code in place, here&#8217;s a 12 hour graph of our website&#8217;s API performance. The dyno wait time for our application, in green, averaged 61.1ms for a total of 301ms average per request, which is 1/5th of the total request time. It&#8217;s certainly a lot, but we do spend a lot more time in our own code.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2013-02-17-impact-of-heroku-routing-mesh-and-random-routing/newrelic-12-hours.png"></p>

<p>Note that the single peak on the right of the graph corresponds to a dyno auto-scale job. We double the number of dynos with early morning traffic, which causes new dynos to boot up and accumulate requests before they are &#8220;warm&#8221; enough to process requests at their normal rate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An infinite scroll can be a beautiful and functional way to present feed data. You can see ours on the <a href="http://artsy.net/">homepage of artsy.net</a>. It works by fetching a few items from the API, then fetching some more items as the user scrolls down the feed. Each API call returns the items along with a &#8220;cursor&#8221;, which marks the position of the last item retrieved. Subsequent API calls include the cursor in the query string and the iteration resumes from there.</p>

<p>Why use a cursor and not standard pagination? Because inserting an item on top of the feed would shift the existing items down, causing the API to return a duplicate item on the page boundary. Removing an item from the top of the feed would pull the remaining items up, causing an item to be missed in the next request on the page boundary.</p>

<p>Today we&#8217;re open-sourcing a small gem called <a href="https://github.com/dblock/mongoid-scroll">mongoid-scroll</a>, which implements this cursor-like behavior for MongoDB using mongoid or moped. Here&#8217;s how it works.</p>
