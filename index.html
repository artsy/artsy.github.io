        <p>Good team culture strives for cohesion. Once organizations get large enough, a tension emerges between the culture
of individual teams and the culture of the larger organization. How do you achieve team cohesion across small teams
<em>and</em> the larger organizations they comprise?</p>

<p>The culture at Artsy is driven by every team member, not mandated or handed down from above. This adds another
level of tension, between individuals and their smaller teams. Team working agreements embrace that tension to
provide a framework for converting tension into healthy culture.</p>

        <p>Software deploys! What a concept. You have some code running somewhere, and you need to get it running somewhere
else. What could possibly go wrong? While web developers have become accustom to some <em>really slick</em> deploy
processes, iOS developers have to work within some very different constraints.</p>

<p>Today I want to explore the differences between deploying iOS software and front-end/back-end web software. Some of
these differences are inherent to how the code gets executed, and some of the differences are incidental to choices
that Apple has made. These are constraints that iOS developers need to work within. As Artsy has adopted React
Native over the past four years, we have had more and more of our web engineering colleagues contributing to our
iOS app. For these web engineers, getting familiar with the iOS deploy constraints is as important as getting to
know Xcode and CocoaPods.</p>

        <p>Coordinating changes across many packages in the node ecosystem can be quite the challenge. You can use <code>npm link</code>
or <code>yarn link</code> to create a symlink of the package you're developing on into another package, but it
<a href="https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1761#issuecomment-259706202">has some drawbacks</a>. If you're doing local
development and need to rapidly see updates and <code>yarn link</code> isn't working out there's always tools like
<a href="https://github.com/whitecolor/yalc#yalc">yalc</a> to help you out. That's really only for local development though.</p>

<p>What if you need to test packages together in a staging environment? Generally the approach would to be to deploy a
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html">canary</a> version to npm that you can use in your staging
environment. I'll go over how to do that and how Artsy automates it.</p>

        <p>It's the year 2020. You use a modern front-end stack of <a href="https://relay.dev/">Relay</a>,
<a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>.
You can build an infinite scroll 'feed' type UI totally out of the box with these tools, by mostly putting together
boilerplate (proper <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm#sec-Connection-Types">connections</a>,
along with a <a href="https://relay.dev/docs/en/pagination-container">pagination container</a>). You have a design system, and
are rapidly building up a component library. Things are great!</p>

<p>Then you take a look at the latest design comps for a 'browse' type page, and you see that the
<a href="https://medium.com/simple-human/7-reasons-why-infinite-scrolling-is-probably-a-bad-idea-a0139e13c96b">controversial</a>
infinite scroll has been replaced by a more traditional pagination bar.</p>

<p>You know the one. Like the following, from <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-01-21-graphql-relay-windowed-pagination/amazon.png"></p>

<p>You start to realize that the cursor-based setup of a connection, along with a Relay pagination container, does not
lend itself to this more traditional UI. For one thing, a user can arbitrarily 'jump' to any page by including a
<code>?page=X</code> query param (typically). For another, the user can only actually see the current page of content, versus
a feed. As you go to sleep and dream of REST, Rails controllers, <a href="https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari">kaminari</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate">will_paginate</a>, and a simpler time, you start to have a vision...</p>

        <p>In 2013, Artsy shipped the first version of our iOS app. Typical for an early-day startup, the app was a "minimum
viable product" (with a big emphasis on "minimum"). One of the features that didn't make the cut was something you
expect to see in most apps: a log out button.</p>

<p>When I joined Artsy a year later, there was still no log out button. And there would be no log out button for
another six years, until today.</p>

<p>I want to talk about this quirk of our app, from both product and technical perspectives. Why wasn't this already
in our app? Why was it so difficult to build? These are interesting questions, and their answers shed light on how
products mature over time. I also want to talk about how we finally managed to prioritize this kinda weird feature
request (spoilers: it was our company-wide hackathon). Let's go!</p>

        <p>This will be the first in a series of posts about how we used advanced GraphQL tooling and functionality to better
handle errors occurring during query resolution, and better equip clients to reason about such errors.</p>

<p>The goal is to describe our current approach, but also do a deep dive into specific ways we've extended our
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics">GraphQL server</a> to help us accomplish that. If you are an interested GraphQL
user, you may find this useful, even if some of the larger context specifically around how we are using it to help
standardize error handling doesn't apply.</p>

<p>You consider yourself an introvert, and you really appreciate "engineering time", where you prefer to work for
extended uninterrupted periods because interruptions wreck you. You are used to being misunderstood. Ever since you
can remember the people around you have been kind of baffling: they constantly fail to notice stuff that's really
obvious and important to you, and then they have the audacity to get frustrated with you for not understanding
<em>them</em>.</p>

<p>But whatever, you can deal with this, right? This is just how life goes, right? Everyone's like this, right?</p>

        <p>Regular readers of our blog might be familiar with <a href="https://www.cultureamp.com">Culture Amp</a>, a tool Artsy uses to
collect anonymous feedback and take action on cultural issues (we most recently discussed the tool
<a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/04/19/having-a-coffee-with-every-engineer/">in this blog post</a>). At a
company-wide level, Culture Amp has helped guide everything from Artsy's evolving culture, to our physical work
spaces, to our support for remote work. At an engineering-team level, we've also been using Culture Amp to guide
our choices in technology, documentation, and training.</p>

<p>In this blog post I'll be detailing a recent learning course we ran to share knowledge about how Artsy builds iOS
software for our entire engineering team.</p>

        <p>The Artsy Vanguard is an annual editorial series where we feature up-and-coming, notable, and praiseworthy artists
and their contributions to the art world. 2019 was the second year that Artsy published this special feature,
although we have been publishing custom editorial segments multiple times per year since 2015.</p>

<p><em>In this post, I’ll discuss my recent experience working on the
<a href="https://www.artsy.net/series/artsy-vanguard-2019">2019 Artsy Vanguard</a> editorial feature. I’ll start by
introducing the technology stack behind our articles and then discuss what I learned from both a team/organization
and technical perspective.</em></p>
