  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://art.sy">Art.sy</a> team faithfully uses <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a> for continuous integration. <a href="http://artsy.github.com/blog/2012/05/27/using-jenkins-for-ruby-and-ruby-on-rails-teams/">As we&#8217;ve described before</a>, our Jenkins master and 8 slaves run on Linode. This arrangement has at least a few drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Our Linode servers are manually configured. They require frequent maintenance, and inconsistencies lead to surprising build failures.</li>
<li>The fixed set of slaves don&#8217;t match the pattern of our build jobs: jobs get backed up during the day, but servers are mostly unused overnight and on weekends.</li>
</ul>


<p>The <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Amazon+EC2+Plugin">Amazon EC2 Plugin</a> allowed us to replace those slaves with a totally scripted environment. Now, slaves are spun up in the cloud whenever build jobs need them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Empathy with end users is critical when developing consumer-facing software. Many go <a href="http://innonate.com/2011/03/09/hackers-the-canon-of-consumer-facing-products/">even</a> <a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/self_design/">further</a> and argue that you should <em>be</em> your own user to effectively deliver the best experience.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>I&#8217;d encourage anyone starting a startup to become one of its users, however unnatural it seems.</em></p>

<p>&mdash; Paul Graham <a href="http://paulgraham.com/organic.html">Organic Startup Ideas</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In practice, though, this can be difficult:</p>

<ul>
<li>As a developer, you&#8217;re just not representative of the intended audience.</li>
<li>You&#8217;re [appropriately] focused on the product&#8217;s next iteration, while your audience is occupied with the current state.</li>
<li>You spend countless hours focused on product details&mdash;of course it&#8217;s a challenge to empathize with a casual visitor&#8217;s first impression.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Keeping it Real</h2>

<p>We&#8217;ve tried some best practices to overcome these tendencies. User feedback is emailed to everyone in the company. Engineers share customer support responsibilities. But one simple tool has been surprisingly useful: we stole a page from the agile development handbook and built an <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Information+radiator">information radiator</a>. Like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board">kanban board</a>, news ticker, or <a href="https://demo.geckoboard.com/dashboard/B6782E562794C2F2/">analytics wall board</a>, our information radiator gives us an ambient awareness of end users&#8217; experiences. How?</p>

<h2>R.I.P #!</h2>

<p>It did not take us long to discover we shared the concerns of Twitter&#8217;s
<a href="http://danwebb.net/2011/5/28/it-is-about-the-hashbangs">Dan Webb on hashbang routes</a>,
but it was almost a year before we were able to remove them from art.sy. Here&#8217;s how it went down.</p>

<p>Art.sy relies on the <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a> framework for our client application
which offers a solid pushState routing scheme. This includes a seamless hashtag fallback for
<a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=history">browsers that don&#8217;t support the HTML5 History API</a> (looking at you IE 9).</p>

<p>The pushState routing is optional, but <em>&#8220;the world as it should be&#8221;</em> suggests we say &#8220;Yes!&#8221; (or true) to pushState.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Implementing server-side RESTful API caching is hard. In a straightforward API all the expiry decisions can be made automatically based on the URL, but most real world APIs that add requirements around object relationships or user authorization make caching particularly challenging.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://goruco.com/">GoRuCo</a> we open-sourced <a href="http://github.com/artsy/garner">Garner</a>, a cache implementation of the concepts described in this post. To &#8220;garner&#8221; means to gather data from various sources and to make it readily available in one place, kind-of like a cache! Garner works today with the <a href="http://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape API framework</a> and the <a href="http://github.com/mongoid/mongoid">Mongoid ODM</a>. We encourage you to fork the project, extend our library to other systems and contribute your code back, if you find it useful.</p>

<p>Garner implements the Art.sy API caching cookbook that has been tried by fire in production.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>E-mail is one of the most important ways to engage your users. And every time you touch a user&#8217;s inbox, it reflects on your brand. But getting email right has become increasing difficult due to the complexities introduced by the thousands of web-based, desktop and mobile mail clients. Email formatting is like the &#8220;Hunger Games&#8221; where the major players include online services such as GMail, Yahoo, Hotmail or AOL, desktop clients such as Outlook and a myriad mobile devices ranging from iPhone and Android to Blackberry.</p>

<p>To deal with this landscape, the MIME standard allows systems to send e-mail with multiple parts: <code>plain/text</code> for business-efficient devices such as the Blackberry, and <code>text/html</code> for web-based e-mail readers, such as GMail. Furthermore, <code>ActionMailer</code> supports multiple template formats: create an <code>.html.haml</code> template along with a <code>.txt.haml</code> template to generate both. We also know that <code>text/plain</code> email helps deliverability, but we believe a disproportionately small amount of text e-mails are actually read - the vast majority of devices are capable of parsing some HTML.</p>

<p>Is it possible to avoid having to maintain two separate templates without sacrificing deliverability? How can we inject a <code>text/plain</code> part into HTML e-mail that is both useful and &#8220;free&#8221;?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having over three thousand RSpec tests in a single project has become difficult to manage. We chose to organize these into suites, somewhat mimicking our directory structure. And while we succeeded at making our Capybara integration tests more reliable (see <a href="/blog/2012/02/03/reliably-testing-asynchronous-ui-w-slash-rspec-and-capybara/">Reliably Testing Asynchronous UI with RSpec and Capybara</a>), they continue relying on finicky timeouts. To avoid too many false positives we&#8217;ve put together a system to retry failed tests. We know that a spec that fails twice in a row is definitely not a fluke!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We make Folio, a pretty kick-ass iPad app that we give away to our partners to showcase their inventory at art fairs. Whilst making it we tried to ensure that all of the application fits in with the <a href="http://art.sy">art.sy</a> website aesthetic, and recently the last natively styled control fell to our mighty code hammers. That was the <code>UISearchBar</code>.</p>

<p><img src="http://ortastuff.s3.amazonaws.com/images/custom_searchbar_example.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Artsy Folio" /></p>

<p>When displaying only search results in a table it makes a lot of sense to use Apple&#8217;s <code>UISearchDisplayController</code> as it handles a lot of edge cases for you. However the downside is that you lose some control over how the views interact.</p>

<p>The search bar was the only native control that actually made it into the version 1 release. This was mainly due to it requiring a bit of black magic in order to get it to work the way we wanted. So lets go through the code and rip it to pieces.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why do so many companies write a homegrown pageviews tracking system? Between Google Analytics, Kissmetrics and many others, isn&#8217;t that a completely solved problem?</p>

<p>These popular solutions lack domain knowledge. They are easily capable of segmenting users by region or browser, but they fail to recognize rules core to your business. Tracking pageviews with a homegrown system becomes your next sprint&#8217;s goal.</p>

<p>Implementing a hit counter service is quite tricky. This is a write-heavy, asynchronous problem that must minimize impact on page rendering time, while dealing with rapidly growing amounts of data. Is there a middle ground between using Google Analytics and rolling out our own homegrown implementation? How can we use Google Analytics for data collection and inject domain knowledge into gathered data, incrementally, without writing our own service?</p>
