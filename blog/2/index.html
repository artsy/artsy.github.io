        <p>Recently, I needed to test a button that would make an analytics tracking call using
<a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/react-tracking">react-tracking</a> and then navigate to a new page in a callback. This
presented some challenges - I wasn’t sure how to create a mocked version of react-tracking that would allow a
callback to be passed.</p>

<p>With some help from fellow Artsy engineers <a href="https://github.com/damassi">Christopher Pappas</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/pvinis">Pavlos Vinieratos</a>, I got the tracking and testing to work. Here’s how we did it.</p>

        <p>I recently encountered a problem where client-side data (returned from a Relay query) became out of sync after a
user interaction. How can we make sure our data is consistent while maintaining a single source of truth? This post
explores why a developer might want to update client-side data locally, the basics of Relay and its store, and how
to delete records in the store when you’re not using a mutation.</p>

<h2 id="relay-x-artsy-x-me">Relay x Artsy x Me</h2>

<p><a href="https://relay.dev/">Relay</a> is a GraphQL client library maintained by Facebook engineers and enables rapid client-side data
fetching in React applications. <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/04/10/omakase-relay/">Artsy’s adoption of Relay</a> coincided with our move
toward using React Native for our mobile work around 2016. I joined Artsy as an engineer in November of 2020 (after
<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-losing-my-job-helped-me-find-my-way-back-8c8f86552acc">transitioning to engineering from a non-technical role at the
company</a>.) When I joined, I was about a year into React development
and completely new to Relay.</p>

        <p>A common suggestion for improving pull requests (PRs) is to “make your PR small and focused”. I myself gave this suggestion in <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2020/08/11/improve-pull-requests-by-including-valuable-context/">a recent article on this very blog about including context in PRs</a>.</p>

<p>Like most internet advice, this can feel like the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl">“draw the rest of the owl”</a> meme. Even if we’re in agreement that I <em>should</em> make a PR smaller…<strong><em>how</em></strong> do I do it? How do I avoid a big PR when there’s a lot of cross-cutting changes to make? How do I create small, focused units of work when I’m building a large feature? How can I overcome my perfectionism and submit a PR that feels incomplete to me because the edges aren’t all polished?</p>

        <p>I know that for many developers, especially those early in their careers, asking for help can be intimidating. I
often fear wasting someone’s time or exposing myself as less skilled or smart than my team initially thought.</p>

<p>In my first month as a software engineer at Artsy (and barely six months into life as an engineer after
<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-losing-my-job-helped-me-find-my-way-back-8c8f86552acc">transitioning from a career in communications</a>), I was struggling
through a ticket assigned to me as a “good first issue.” (The team estimated the task to be straightforward enough
for someone new to the team.) After a few hours stumbling between the ticket, my code, and Google, I made very
little progress.</p>

        <p><a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2020/03/02/ios-deploys-super-weird-totally-normal/">In, a recent blog post</a>, I discussed a fundamental difference between web and iOS deployments. Web software is deployed to servers that are under your control, while iOS software is deployed to users’ devices that you have <em>no</em> control over. This distinction really changes how you think about the code that you ship, because that code could be running indefinitely on devices that never get updated.</p>

<p>The previous post focused on this distinction through the lens of accidentally shipping (and then fixing) a bug. This focus on bugs is important, but focusing <em>only</em> on bugs left me unable to articulate an important, nuanced distinction between hosting code and shipping app binaries. So let’s dive in.</p>

        <p>Sharing knowledge! What a concept! <a href="/blog/2020/09/29/becoming-mobile-first-at-artsy/">In my recent blog post</a>, I discussed “Knowledge Share” meetings (also known simply as “Knowledge Shares”, or abbreviated “KS”) and I want to dive deeper into them today. Last time, I described them as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knowledge Shares are a <u>structured</u> time to facilitate <u>unstructured learning</u>. Anyone can bring a topic to Knowledge Share, from a ticket that they’re stuck on to an idea they have to a neat trick they recently learned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These meetings were really instrumental in ramping up the Mobile Experience team, but their history goes back a bit further. Today, we’re going to discuss the origins of Knowledge Shares at Artsy, how they’ve evolved, the value they provide us as engineers, and how I’d recommend you adopt them on your team.</p>

<p>Let’s go!</p>

        <p>It was a Wednesday, mid-summer 2019. I don’t know which Wednesday specifically, but I know that it was <em>a</em>
Wednesday because I was attending Artsy’s weekly all-hands meeting. Two hundred colleagues were also there (many
dialing in remotely) and we were all listening to
<a href="https://files.artsy.net/documents/artsy-names-new-ceo.pdf">Artsy’s new CEO</a> talk about the company’s direction.
Mike Steib had only been around for a few months at that point, getting to know the business. He was talking about
the product direction, and I was listening intently.</p>

<p>With Artsy’s iOS app, I knew there were only really two directions we could go. As I listened, I reflected on how
we had gotten here.</p>

        <p>In 2017, Artsy adopted <a href="https://relay.dev/en/">Relay</a> in both its front-end web and iOS codebases (using React and
React Native, respectively). Generally speaking, this investment has turned out very well for us! Relay empowers
product teams to quickly iterate on new features and to share common infrastructure across web and iOS codebases.
However, most of the original engineers who pioneered using Relay at Artsy have since moved on to their next role;
this has left a knowledge gap where Artsy engineers are comfortable <em>using</em> Relay, but they don’t totally
understand how it works.</p>

<p>This is a problem as old as software engineering itself, and it has a simple solution: learn and then teach others.
We’ll be driving a peer learning group centering around Relay, but today we are going to dive into the part of
Relay that comes up the most in requests for pairing: getting Relay pagination to work. (Note: we’re going to use

        <p>This blog post is going to motivate and describe Artsy’s adoption and evolution
of the usage of review apps.</p>

<p>This first part of this post covers a couple of common problems where

<p>The rest of the post describes Artsy’s history with review app automation via
incremental problem solving and the composition of a few well-known technologies.</p>
