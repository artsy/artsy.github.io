        <article class='post'>
          <p>We recently got a report from one of our galleries in the Los Angeles area that
they weren’t showing up on our
<a href="https://www.artsy.net/shows/los-angeles-ca-usa">Los Angeles exhibition listings</a>.</p>

<p>I fielded the report and right away confirmed: when we asked our core API for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/shows?near=&lt;los angeles coordinates&gt;</code>, sure enough this gallery partner didn’t
make the cut.</p>

<p>Turns out they are based in Santa Monica, a separate and neighboring
municipality. They must not be within the 25km radius that we use by default for
these sorts of queries.</p>

<p><em>Case closed</em>. Or so I thought.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>After some back and forth with our partner I decided to investigate more
thoroughly, this time using some tricks of the trade from
<a href="https://www.anandarooproy.com">my other life</a> outside of Artsy.</p>

<h2 id="casting-a-wider-net">Casting a wider net</h2>

<p>If there was something wrong with our 25km radius query, I wanted to start by
casting a wider net and visualizing the results.</p>

<p>I consulted our Rails application code to find the query logic in question, and
then issued the same query directly to MongoDB. Something like the following
query (simplified for clarity):</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// a $geoWithin $center query</span>

<span class="nx">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">events</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">find</span><span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="na">coordinates</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">$geoWithin</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="na">$center</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">118.24</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">34.05</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="mi">25</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mf">111.32</span><span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
<span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the query above we are asking MongoDB to give us all events within a 25km
radius around the point 34.05°N, 118.24°W which we have designated as a central
point within Los Angeles. For our purposes in this post we can consider “events”
≈ “exhibitions” ≈ “shows.”</p>

<p>We are not asking for the 25km radius directly, but rather converting it into an
equivalent amount of geographic degrees by using a conversion factor of 1° ≈
111.32 kilometers, a factor which is true at enough the equator.</p>

<p>I modified the above query to cast a 50km net in order to see if there were some
edges cases that needed scrutiny. Taking the resulting JSON response, I fired up
<a href="https://www.placemark.io/">Placemark</a>, my favorite new tool for wrangling
geospatial data.</p>

<p>(Incidentally I recommend reading Tom Macwright’s
<a href="https://macwright.com/2023/01/28/placemark.html">recent reflection on creating Placemark</a>
as a bootstrapped indie developer.)</p>

<figure class="illustration">

  <figcaption>All shows within a 50km radius</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="ball-of-confusion">Ball of confusion</h2>

<p>One nice feature of Placemark is that it lets us place geodesic circles on the
map, that is, circles that represent a constant radius around a point, as
plotted on a globe.</p>

<p>When I placed a 25km radius circle on the map, something stood out immediately.</p>

<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/2.png" alt="Screenshot of a visualization in Placemark showing Los Angeles area exhibitions within a 50km radius, with a 25km radius superimposed." />
  <figcaption>25km radius superimposed. <a style="padding-bottom: 1px; border-bottom: solid 1px lightgray" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_of_Confusion_%28That%27s_What_the_World_Is_Today%29">Ball of Confusion</a>, that's what the world was that day.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The partner in question is highlighted in pink — and is clearly within the 25km
radius. <strong>What gives?</strong></p>

<p>By spot-checking a few points on the map against our current geo query I found
that edge cases near the top or bottom of the circle were likely to be evaluated
correctly, while edges cases at the left and right were being incorrectly
omitted, as our partner gallery was.</p>

<p>A fuller visualization of that finding would look like this:</p>

<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/3.png" alt="Screenshot of a visualization in Placemark showing the results of a $geoWithin $center query" />
  <figcaption>Results of a <code>$geoWithin $center</code> query around Los Angeles, evaluated against a grid of test points.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A distinctly <em>non</em>-circular circle — that rung a bell.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-one-way-to-draw-a-circle-on-the-earth">More than one way to draw a circle on the Earth</h2>

<p>It was at this point that I recalled the specific form of the geospatial query
our code was performing, and consulted the
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/geoWithin/">MongoDB docs for the $geoWithin query</a>.</p>

<p>Turns out that you can invoke this as a radius query in one of two ways, by
specifying
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/center/">$center</a>
or
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/centerSphere/">$centerSphere</a>.</p>

<p>Per the
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/center/#behavior">docs</a>
for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$center</code>, this query…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>calculates distances using flat (planar) geometry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us pause for a moment to note that while only some maps are
<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo27400568.html">deceitful</a>,
<em>all</em> maps are untruths. In the sense that they flatten three dimensions down to
two, and inevitably distort the world in the process.</p>

<p>The surface of a three-dimensional globe cannot be flattened down to a
two-dimensional plane without some stretching or tearing, any more than an
orange peel can be. The mathematical algorithms for turning those three
dimensions into two are what we know as map projections. (Ah, the good old days
when “dimensionality reduction” meant <em>from three to two</em>.)</p>

<p>If you do your distance calculations in such a flattened, projected coordinate
system — as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$geoWithin $center</code> query does — then you are accepting
whatever distortions are inherent to that projection.</p>

<p>That’s the situation we were in. We thought we were catching everything inside
the green circle, but in fact we were only catching everything inside the red
egg:</p>

<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/5.png" alt="Screenshot of a visualization in Placemark showing the results of a $geoWithin $center query compared to the expected results" />
  <figcaption>Actual <code>$geoWithin $center</code> results vs. expected results.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And our unfortunate partner was <em>just</em> outside the egg, thus being incorrectly
omitted.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-the-query">Fixing the query</h2>

<p>Luckily the solution was simple.</p>

<p>As noted above MongoDB supports a second variant for radius queries using a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$centerSphere</code> operator instead of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$center</code> that we were using.</p>

<p>Per the
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/centerSphere/">docs</a>
for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$centerSphere</code>, this version…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>defines a circle for a geospatial query that uses spherical geometry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, this query effectively draws our circle on the three-dimensional
globe rather than on the stretched and distorted two-dimensional map.</p>

<p>We just need to rewrite our query as follows:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// a $geoWithin $centerSphere query</span>

<span class="nx">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">events</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">find</span><span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="na">coordinates</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">$geoWithin</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// $center: [[-118.24, 34.05], 25 / 111.32],    /* BEFORE */</span>
      <span class="na">$centerSphere</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">118.24</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">34.05</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="mi">25</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mf">6378.1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="cm">/* AFTER */</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
<span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is a new conversion factor in play here, this time denoting that the
radius of the earth is approximately 6378.1 km. In this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$centerSphere</code> flavor
of the query we are working in unprojected
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system">spherical coordinates</a>,
measured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">radians</a>. Thus we need to
account for the size of the sphere that we are calculating upon.</p>

<p>We can re-run
<a href="https://gist.github.com/anandaroop/a1b794559615b2bbdea097678321c93f">our test</a>
with this version of the query, and now we see that the results are finally in
line with what we were expecting:</p>

<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/4.png" alt="Screenshot of a visualization in Placemark showing the results of a $geoWithin $centerSphere query" />
  <figcaption>Results of a <code>$geoWithin $centerSphere</code> query around Los Angeles, evaluated against a grid of test points.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Having updated our API to use this variant of the query, we solved the problem
and returned our partner gallery to its rightful place in our listings, as shown
by the pink highlight above.</p>

<p>That was the happy ending we were looking for.</p>

<h2 id="a-postscript-on-map-distortion">A postscript on map distortion</h2>

<p>But if you’re curious to learn a little more about map distortion, let’s dig a
bit deeper into the nature of the problem that we were encountering.</p>

<p>Returning to <a href="https://www.placemark.io/">Placemark</a>’s ability to draw different
kinds of circles on the map, let’s now place a <em>geographic</em> circle on the map
rather than a geodesic one. This one is computed in the simplest possible map
projection — a geographic projection where we simply treat the longitude as the
X coordinate and the latitude as the Y coordinate. (This projection goes by many
names, such as “geographic”, “equirectangular”, “Plate Carrée” or even
<em>“unprojected”</em>, which is not quite accurate.)</p>

<p>This corresponds to what you get when you use MongoDB’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$geoWithin</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$center</code>
query on geospatial data:</p>

<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/6.gif" alt="Animation showing the distortion a geographic circle encounters at various latitudes" />
  <figcaption>Animation showing the distortion a geographic circle encounters at various latitudes.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see, we get: a moderately oblong egg at the latitude of Los Angeles;
a nice circle as we get close to the equator; and a very oblong egg as we
approach the poles.</p>

<p>If you are wondering why you should trust my claims about the egginess of <em>this</em>
two-dimensional image after I just said that all such maps are lies — good
question!</p>

<p>It just so happens that nearly all web-based interactive maps, including
Placemark, use a variation of the Mercator projection, the one you might
remember from schoolroom maps. Mercator is a so-called
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map_projection">conformal</a>”
projection, meaning that <em>its</em> particular lie is to sacrifice area in favor of
shape.</p>

<p>A shape drawn on a globe will be correctly maintained in a Mercator map, but the
scale will vary across the map: true at the equator and very incorrect towards
the poles. This is the reason for the common complaint that
<a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news-blog/data-visualisation-animated-map-mercater-projection-true-size-countries">Mercator maps show Greenland as about the same size as Africa</a>,
when in fact Africa is about 14 times larger.</p>

<p>The amount and nature of the distortion introduced by map projections is such an
important topic that cartographers have long relied on a clever technique for
communicating this distortion visually, known as
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissot%27s_indicatrix">Tissot’s indicatrix</a>.”</p>

<p>To give you a sense of the kind of distortion we encountered with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$center</code>
query, here is what Tissot’s indicatrix looks like for the geographic
projection. This shows essentially the inverse of the animation above — what
does a true circle plotted on the globe look like at various locations on this
map projection?</p>

<figure class="illustration">

</figure>

<p>Now, imagine the inverse operation of this ⤴︎, drawing <em>true</em> circles on this
planar space, in order to get a sense of how distorted your query results on a
globe would be.</p>

<p>Finally, here is Tissot’s indicatrix for the Mercator projection, demonstrating
its ability to preserve shapes at the expense of sizes.</p>

<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/8.png" alt="Tissot's indicatrix for Mercator projection" />

</figure>

<p>An interesting recent development is that the web’s reliance on Mercator is
changing, but only very slowly.
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/5/17653122/google-maps-update-mercator-projection-earth-isnt-flat">Google began to make this change</a>
a few years ago, and
<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/adaptive-projections">Mapbox has written about their approach</a>
as well.</p>

<p>Hopefully this digression into the display of geospatial data has been
illuminating. There is much more to say on this topic, since geospatial is more
or less one asterisk after another. For example, we haven’t mentioned that the
Mercator projection above is incapable of depicting the north or south poles at
all! Nor have we touched on MongoDB’s various geospatial
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/geospatial-queries/#geospatial-data">data formats</a>,
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/geospatial-queries/#geospatial-indexes">indexes</a>,
or
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/near/">the $near query</a>
and its spherical sibling
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/nearSphere/">the $nearSphere query</a>,
all worthy topics.</p>

<p>But we hope that understanding this crucial distinction between planar
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$center</code>) and spherical (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$centerSphere</code>) calculations will help you make the
right choice when devising your own radius queries with MongoDB or other
geospatial engines.</p>
