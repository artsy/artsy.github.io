        <p>On Valentine's day in 2014, @alloy made our first commit moving the Artsy Mobile team to JavaScript, and paving the
way to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3loALSVQM">shared Omakase JavaScript stack across web + iOS</a>. We've done a write-up at <a href="/blog/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/">6 months</a>, <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/">1 year</a>,
<a href="/blog/2018/03/17/two-years-of-react-native/">2 years</a> and at 2.5 years we collaborated on a React Native conference with Facebook which features a <a href="http://artsy.net/x-react-native">very long
Q&amp;A</a> session with the people who worked on, and with our React Native stack.</p>

<p>Our experience has been really positive building a single platform data-driven app. We've been able to drastically
increase the number of contributors to the codebase and with minimal guidance, web-developers are able to be
productive and ship features to our iOS apps.</p>

<p>That said, for this 3 year anniversary, I want to dive deeper into some of the less positive aspects of our
transition. We think these trade-offs are worth it, and that this may be what a successful cultural transition
eventually looks like for some companies.</p>

        <p>First of all, that's very exciting! Software engineering is pretty darn cool—you get to learn lots of new things,
understand the technology you use every day better, and contribute to the mysterious maw known as "the internet".</p>

<p>Last February, I also decided that I wanted to pursue computer engineering. I'd been at Artsy for a bit less than
two years at that point, first as a marketing intern working on SEO and then as a coordinator on the CRM (read:
email) team. I'd consistently been working on small technical projects; first doing
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/positron/commit/3176282a3ea94c626e9d851b7c0dd27a1bb0fcb4">some work</a> on a tool for SEO
optimization for our Editorial team, then building
<a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/11/19/mjml/">emails with MJML</a>, and a few other bits and bobs. But I didn't think
of it as a serious pursuit.</p>

<p>Mostly, that was due to my experience programming in the past—I did about half a CS major in undergrad. At the
time, I felt that programming wasn't right for me, and I dropped the major during my third year.</p>

<p>It was Artsy's Engineering team that convinced me that programming was something that I both wanted to and could
do. Our engineers have always welcomed learners and been happy to answer questions and empower other teams to do
technical work. I eventually realized that the parts of my work where I was coding were the parts I enjoyed the
most, and that I would likely feel more fulfilled if I made programming my full-time occupation.</p>

<p>Here's what that journey looked like. Hopefully my experience proves helpful to you as you begin (or finish) yours!</p>

<p>On select occasions since 2015, Artsy Editorial has created a number of custom, one-off articles featuring unique layouts, styles and experiences. After trying a number of implementations, the <a href="https://github.com/artsy/reaction/tree/master/src/Components/Publishing/EditorialFeature"><code>EditorialFeature</code></a> component was introduced to the process during Artsy’s 2018 year-in-review projects.</p>

<p>By moving the implementation of custom articles to Artsy’s component library, we were able to remove some of the friction and time investment necessary for engineers to spin up these articles, and enable bespoke layouts to be housed in Artsy.net’s Article domain rather than a custom Express app. Acting essentially as a wrapper to accept article data, any component can be rendered as a child of the <code>EditorialFeature</code> component, allowing for flexible combinations of new and existing features, and for minimal or maximal interventions.</p>

        <p>This blog just passed the 7 year mark from our initial <a href="/blog/2012/01/05/hello-world/">"Hello World"</a> post. We've always built and hosted our
own blog, initially <a href="/blog/2012/01/18/octopress-and-jekyll/">using OctoPress</a> but eventually migrating to just plain old Jekyll.</p>

<p>Artsy uses 3 separate editorial platforms now, we built our own for <a href="https://www.artsy.net/articles">Artsy Magazine</a>, use Medium for our <a href="https://www.artsy.net/life-at-artsy">Life
at Artsy blog</a> and Jekyll for the engineering blog. There was a healthy debate about whether we would migrate
to one, or two systems, but I had pretty strong opinions on migrating the engineering blog to Medium and nipped
that in the bud pretty quickly.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/signal-v-noise-exits-medium/">Signal vs Noise</a> being a high profile of a example of migrating to Medium and back again, I thought it's
worth taking the time to examine our reasoning for doing it ourselves.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of January we discovered an interesting note in <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29288">TypeScript's roadmap</a> about linting:</p>

<blockquote><p>In a survey we ran in VS Code a few months back, the most frequent theme we heard from users was that the linting
experience left much to be desired. Since part of our team is dedicated to editing experiences in JavaScript, our
editor team set out to add support for both TSLint and ESLint. However, we noticed that there were a few
architectural issues with the way TSLint rules operate that impacted performance. Fixing TSLint to operate more
efficiently would require a different API which would break existing rules (unless an interop API was built like
what wotan provides).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, ESLint already has the more-performant architecture we're looking for from a linter. Additionally,
different communities of users often have lint rules (e.g. rules for React Hooks or Vue) that are built for
ESLint, but not TSLint.</p>

<p>Given this, our editor team will be focusing on leveraging ESLint rather than duplicating work. For scenarios
that ESLint currently doesn't cover (e.g. semantic linting or program-wide linting), we'll be working on sending
contributions to bring ESLint's TypeScript support to parity with TSLint. As an initial testbed of how this works
in practice, we'll be switching the TypeScript repository over to using ESLint, and sending any new rules
upstream.</p></blockquote>

<p>At Artsy we've been using TSLint for a few years now; it's worked well for us, and we've even written our own
<a href="https://github.com/relay-tools/tslint-plugin-relay">custom rules</a>. However, given the vastness of the JS ecosystem
and how fast it moves, it's easy to recognize this announcement as an exciting moment for tooling simplicity.</p>

        <p>Interviewing is hard. Interviewers want to make sure they're hiring the person who will add the most value to their
team; candidates want to make sure they're joining a company that aligns with their goals and perspectives.</p>

<p>Recent trends in hiring are white-boarding sessions, trivia questions, and hours of take-home assignments. At
Artsy, we don't use any of these. We often get asked why not - and how we assess technical skill without them.</p>

        <p>At Artsy we’ve been moving towards GraphQL for all of our new services. Acknowledging GraphQL is a relatively new
technology, we faced some challenging questions as we were developing one our most recent services.</p>

<p>Naively as my first attempt to define GraphQL types and schemas, I naturally tried to map our database models to
GraphQL types. While this may work for lot of cases, we may not be utilizing some of the useful features that come
with GraphQL that can make the consuming our data a lot easier.</p>

<a name="GraphQL:.Interface.or.Union."></a>
<h2>GraphQL: Interface or Union?</h2>

<p>Think of the case where we are trying to expose search functionality and the result of our search can be either a
<code>Book</code> , <code>Movie</code> or <code>Album</code>. One way to think about this is to have our search query return something like:</p>

        <p>Last year, <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/05/07/fully-automated-standups/">I wrote about the process of fully automating our weekly engineering-wide standup</a>. One of
the benefits of automating what <em>was</em> a meeting run by a single person to a meeting run by everyone is that we
removed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure">single point of failure</a>. However, I may have fibbed just slightly when I called our standups
<em>fully</em> automated.</p>

<p>This blog post is going to cover how (and more importantly, <em>why</em>) I finally automated the last 5% of our weekly
standups. Let's go!</p>

        <p>It's been three years, and <a href="https://swift.org/package-manager/">Swift Package Manager</a> (SPM) is at a point where it can be useful for iOS
projects. It'll take a bit of sacrifice and a little bit of community spirit to fix some holes probably but <strong>in my
opinion, it's time for teams to start adopting SPM for their 3rd party dev tools</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> You should be using SPM for 3rd party dev tools like: <a href="https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint">SwiftLint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat">SwiftFormat</a>, <a href="https://danger.systems/swift/">Danger</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery">Sourcery</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen/">SwiftGen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/orta/Komondor">Git Hook management</a>.</p>

<p>This post covers: What made it feasible to use SPM now? What are the downsides of the status quo? Why use SPM at
all? What are the downsides to using SPM?</p>

        <p>In the JavaScript world, the idea of deploying your libraries on every PR is pretty common. As someone who runs a
dependency manager but comes from a native background, it's easy for me to cringe and imagine the strain this puts
on NPM's servers. However, that is where the ecosystem is and <a href="https://github.com/artsy/reaction/issues/388">continuous deployment</a> can be really useful. So,
about a year ago <a href="https://github.com/artsy/reaction/pull/521">we started</a> moving a lot of our libraries to do this at Artsy too. Starting with our most
critical dependencies:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/artsy/reaction#readme">Reaction</a> (our React components used in many of our web apps)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/artsy/palette#readme">Palette</a> (our <a href="https://palette.artsy.net">design system</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>We started off using a commit message based workflow, but have just finished the migrating to a GitHub Label based
workflow that is less workload on individual contributors. This post will cover how, and why.</p>
