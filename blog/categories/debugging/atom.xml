    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We recently got a report from one of our galleries in the Los Angeles area that
they weren’t showing up on our
<a href="https://www.artsy.net/shows/los-angeles-ca-usa">Los Angeles exhibition listings</a>.</p>

<p>I fielded the report and right away confirmed: when we asked our core API for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/shows?near=&lt;los angeles coordinates&gt;</code>, sure enough this gallery partner didn’t
make the cut.</p>

<p>Turns out they are based in Santa Monica, a separate and neighboring
municipality. They must not be within the 25km radius that we use by default for
these sorts of queries.</p>

<p><em>Case closed</em>. Or so I thought.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>After some back and forth with our partner I decided to investigate more
thoroughly, this time using some tricks of the trade from
<a href="https://www.anandarooproy.com">my other life</a> outside of Artsy.</p>

<h2 id="casting-a-wider-net">Casting a wider net</h2>

<p>If there was something wrong with our 25km radius query, I wanted to start by
casting a wider net and visualizing the results.</p>

<p>I consulted our Rails application code to find the query logic in question, and
then issued the same query directly to MongoDB. Something like the following
query (simplified for clarity):</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// a $geoWithin $center query</span>

<span class="nx">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">events</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">find</span><span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="na">coordinates</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">$geoWithin</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="na">$center</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">118.24</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">34.05</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="mi">25</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mf">111.32</span><span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
<span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the query above we are asking MongoDB to give us all events within a 25km
radius around the point 34.05°N, 118.24°W which we have designated as a central
point within Los Angeles. For our purposes in this post we can consider “events”
≈ “exhibitions” ≈ “shows.”</p>

<p>We are not asking for the 25km radius directly, but rather converting it into an
equivalent amount of geographic degrees by using a conversion factor of 1° ≈
111.32 kilometers, a factor which is true at enough the equator.</p>

<p>I modified the above query to cast a 50km net in order to see if there were some
edges cases that needed scrutiny. Taking the resulting JSON response, I fired up
<a href="https://www.placemark.io/">Placemark</a>, my favorite new tool for wrangling
geospatial data.</p>

<p>(Incidentally I recommend reading Tom Macwright’s
<a href="https://macwright.com/2023/01/28/placemark.html">recent reflection on creating Placemark</a>
as a bootstrapped indie developer.)</p>

<figure class="illustration">

  <figcaption>All shows within a 50km radius</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="ball-of-confusion">Ball of confusion</h2>

<p>One nice feature of Placemark is that it lets us place geodesic circles on the
map, that is, circles that represent a constant radius around a point, as
plotted on a globe.</p>

<p>When I placed a 25km radius circle on the map, something stood out immediately.</p>

<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/2.png" alt="Screenshot of a visualization in Placemark showing Los Angeles area exhibitions within a 50km radius, with a 25km radius superimposed." />
  <figcaption>25km radius superimposed. <a style="padding-bottom: 1px; border-bottom: solid 1px lightgray" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_of_Confusion_%28That%27s_What_the_World_Is_Today%29">Ball of Confusion</a>, that's what the world was that day.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The partner in question is highlighted in pink — and is clearly within the 25km
radius. <strong>What gives?</strong></p>

<p>By spot-checking a few points on the map against our current geo query I found
that edge cases near the top or bottom of the circle were likely to be evaluated
correctly, while edges cases at the left and right were being incorrectly
omitted, as our partner gallery was.</p>

<p>A fuller visualization of that finding would look like this:</p>

<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/3.png" alt="Screenshot of a visualization in Placemark showing the results of a $geoWithin $center query" />
  <figcaption>Results of a <code>$geoWithin $center</code> query around Los Angeles, evaluated against a grid of test points.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A distinctly <em>non</em>-circular circle — that rung a bell.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-one-way-to-draw-a-circle-on-the-earth">More than one way to draw a circle on the Earth</h2>

<p>It was at this point that I recalled the specific form of the geospatial query
our code was performing, and consulted the
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/geoWithin/">MongoDB docs for the $geoWithin query</a>.</p>

<p>Turns out that you can invoke this as a radius query in one of two ways, by
specifying
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/center/">$center</a>
or
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/centerSphere/">$centerSphere</a>.</p>

<p>Per the
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/center/#behavior">docs</a>
for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$center</code>, this query…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>calculates distances using flat (planar) geometry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us pause for a moment to note that while only some maps are
<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo27400568.html">deceitful</a>,
<em>all</em> maps are untruths. In the sense that they flatten three dimensions down to
two, and inevitably distort the world in the process.</p>

<p>The surface of a three-dimensional globe cannot be flattened down to a
two-dimensional plane without some stretching or tearing, any more than an
orange peel can be. The mathematical algorithms for turning those three
dimensions into two are what we know as map projections. (Ah, the good old days
when “dimensionality reduction” meant <em>from three to two</em>.)</p>

<p>If you do your distance calculations in such a flattened, projected coordinate
system — as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$geoWithin $center</code> query does — then you are accepting
whatever distortions are inherent to that projection.</p>

<p>That’s the situation we were in. We thought we were catching everything inside
the green circle, but in fact we were only catching everything inside the red
egg:</p>

<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/5.png" alt="Screenshot of a visualization in Placemark showing the results of a $geoWithin $center query compared to the expected results" />
  <figcaption>Actual <code>$geoWithin $center</code> results vs. expected results.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And our unfortunate partner was <em>just</em> outside the egg, thus being incorrectly
omitted.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-the-query">Fixing the query</h2>

<p>Luckily the solution was simple.</p>

<p>As noted above MongoDB supports a second variant for radius queries using a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$centerSphere</code> operator instead of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$center</code> that we were using.</p>

<p>Per the
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/centerSphere/">docs</a>
for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$centerSphere</code>, this version…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>defines a circle for a geospatial query that uses spherical geometry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, this query effectively draws our circle on the three-dimensional
globe rather than on the stretched and distorted two-dimensional map.</p>

<p>We just need to rewrite our query as follows:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// a $geoWithin $centerSphere query</span>

<span class="nx">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">events</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">find</span><span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="na">coordinates</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">$geoWithin</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// $center: [[-118.24, 34.05], 25 / 111.32],    /* BEFORE */</span>
      <span class="na">$centerSphere</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">118.24</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">34.05</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="mi">25</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mf">6378.1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="cm">/* AFTER */</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
<span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is a new conversion factor in play here, this time denoting that the
radius of the earth is approximately 6378.1 km. In this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$centerSphere</code> flavor
of the query we are working in unprojected
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system">spherical coordinates</a>,
measured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">radians</a>. Thus we need to
account for the size of the sphere that we are calculating upon.</p>

<p>We can re-run
<a href="https://gist.github.com/anandaroop/a1b794559615b2bbdea097678321c93f">our test</a>
with this version of the query, and now we see that the results are finally in
line with what we were expecting:</p>

<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/4.png" alt="Screenshot of a visualization in Placemark showing the results of a $geoWithin $centerSphere query" />
  <figcaption>Results of a <code>$geoWithin $centerSphere</code> query around Los Angeles, evaluated against a grid of test points.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Having updated our API to use this variant of the query, we solved the problem
and returned our partner gallery to its rightful place in our listings, as shown
by the pink highlight above.</p>

<p>That was the happy ending we were looking for.</p>

<h2 id="a-postscript-on-map-distortion">A postscript on map distortion</h2>

<p>But if you’re curious to learn a little more about map distortion, let’s dig a
bit deeper into the nature of the problem that we were encountering.</p>

<p>Returning to <a href="https://www.placemark.io/">Placemark</a>’s ability to draw different
kinds of circles on the map, let’s now place a <em>geographic</em> circle on the map
rather than a geodesic one. This one is computed in the simplest possible map
projection — a geographic projection where we simply treat the longitude as the
X coordinate and the latitude as the Y coordinate. (This projection goes by many
names, such as “geographic”, “equirectangular”, “Plate Carrée” or even
<em>“unprojected”</em>, which is not quite accurate.)</p>

<p>This corresponds to what you get when you use MongoDB’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$geoWithin</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$center</code>
query on geospatial data:</p>

<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/6.gif" alt="Animation showing the distortion a geographic circle encounters at various latitudes" />
  <figcaption>Animation showing the distortion a geographic circle encounters at various latitudes.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see, we get: a moderately oblong egg at the latitude of Los Angeles;
a nice circle as we get close to the equator; and a very oblong egg as we
approach the poles.</p>

<p>If you are wondering why you should trust my claims about the egginess of <em>this</em>
two-dimensional image after I just said that all such maps are lies — good
question!</p>

<p>It just so happens that nearly all web-based interactive maps, including
Placemark, use a variation of the Mercator projection, the one you might
remember from schoolroom maps. Mercator is a so-called
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map_projection">conformal</a>”
projection, meaning that <em>its</em> particular lie is to sacrifice area in favor of
shape.</p>

<p>A shape drawn on a globe will be correctly maintained in a Mercator map, but the
scale will vary across the map: true at the equator and very incorrect towards
the poles. This is the reason for the common complaint that
<a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news-blog/data-visualisation-animated-map-mercater-projection-true-size-countries">Mercator maps show Greenland as about the same size as Africa</a>,
when in fact Africa is about 14 times larger.</p>

<p>The amount and nature of the distortion introduced by map projections is such an
important topic that cartographers have long relied on a clever technique for
communicating this distortion visually, known as
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissot%27s_indicatrix">Tissot’s indicatrix</a>.”</p>

<p>To give you a sense of the kind of distortion we encountered with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$center</code>
query, here is what Tissot’s indicatrix looks like for the geographic
projection. This shows essentially the inverse of the animation above — what
does a true circle plotted on the globe look like at various locations on this
map projection?</p>

<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/7.png" alt="Tissot's indicatrix for equirectangular projection" />

</figure>

<p>Now, imagine the inverse operation of this ⤴︎, drawing <em>true</em> circles on this
planar space, in order to get a sense of how distorted your query results on a
globe would be.</p>

<p>Finally, here is Tissot’s indicatrix for the Mercator projection, demonstrating
its ability to preserve shapes at the expense of sizes.</p>

<figure class="illustration">

</figure>

<p>An interesting recent development is that the web’s reliance on Mercator is
changing, but only very slowly.
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/5/17653122/google-maps-update-mercator-projection-earth-isnt-flat">Google began to make this change</a>
a few years ago, and
<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/adaptive-projections">Mapbox has written about their approach</a>
as well.</p>

<p>Hopefully this digression into the display of geospatial data has been
illuminating. There is much more to say on this topic, since geospatial is more
or less one asterisk after another. For example, we haven’t mentioned that the
Mercator projection above is incapable of depicting the north or south poles at
all! Nor have we touched on MongoDB’s various geospatial
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/geospatial-queries/#geospatial-data">data formats</a>,
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/geospatial-queries/#geospatial-indexes">indexes</a>,
or
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/near/">the $near query</a>
and its spherical sibling
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/nearSphere/">the $nearSphere query</a>,
all worthy topics.</p>

<p>But we hope that understanding this crucial distinction between planar
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$center</code>) and spherical (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$centerSphere</code>) calculations will help you make the
right choice when devising your own radius queries with MongoDB or other
geospatial engines.</p>

    <link href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/11/05/Using-OCR-To-Fix-A-Hilarious-Bug/"/>
    <updated>2015-11-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/11/05/Using-OCR-To-Fix-A-Hilarious-Bug</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a little while, we would get very strange bug reports. People would complain that artist thumbnails (viewed in several different contexts across the web and our iOS apps) would not be an image of the artist’s work, but rather text, which had inexplicably become an actual JPG. This wasn’t just text appearing in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code> that should contain an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">img</code> or something like that, these were actual JPG’s that were pictures of text.</p>

<p>We would fix these as they came up, chalking the strangeness up to some relic of an old image processing pipeline, data being migrated, etc.</p>

<p>However, the reports kept coming in. This blog post is about how we diagnosed this actual bug, and how we used a simple Ruby script and OCR to help us detect and fix the existing images.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Here’s an example of a bug report where the thumbnail for <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/marina-abramovic-1">Marina Abramović</a> became the text of her bio.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-11-12-hilarious-bug/search.png" alt="Bad Search" /></p>

<p>Here’s one from our <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen">iOS app</a> showing that thumbnails for related artists are set to their bios as well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-11-12-hilarious-bug/eigen.png" alt="Bad Related Artists" /></p>

<p>Weird right? We eventually tracked down what was going on, and it’s actually perfectly summarized in <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/pull/3356">this issue</a>. When someone copies text from Excel, it also generates an image of that cell or cells, and puts it into the clipboard. We immediately suspected something with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pasteZone</code>, and the bug was easy to reproduce - have an image in your clipboard and paste anywhere on the page.</p>

<p>We have an admin panel that allows some metadata about an artist to be edited. This includes their bio, as well as a place to upload a representative image as their ‘cover thumbnail’.</p>

<p>As the issue describes, we had some text input fields, as well as a file upload form using <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload">Blueimp’s jQuery File Upload</a>. When you don’t specify a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pasteZone</code> it defaults to the entire document. This means that a paste event anywhere on the page will trigger that event.</p>

<p>Our editorial team was using Microsoft Excel and Word to organize some data about the artist, including bios. When ready, a team member would copy and paste the bio into the bio input text field. This would also immediately fire the event for the image upload, which now automagically became an actual picture of the text of the bio. Our API and image processing pipeline would happily accept that, leading to the incredibly bizarre bug reports.</p>

<p>My immediate fix was to specify and scope <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pasteZone</code> (and similarly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dropZone</code>) to the element the file upload widget was bound to. That would prevent the problem from happening again. Taking a quick look art some random samples of artists, it looked like potentially thousands of records might have been affected and I became interested in a programmatic way to detect these images. A manual approach would have been very cumbersome.</p>

<p>Since the images were that of text, I decided to use OCR to remove artist thumbnails that it determined had ‘too much text’. This may have unset valid covers from artists that use lots of text in their work, such as <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/joseph-kosuth">Joseph Kosuth</a>. However, this was safe to do since we have some custom logic to fall back to an image of an iconic artwork by the artist in the case of a missing thumbnail.</p>

<p>To get OCR functionality in Ruby, I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">Tesseract</a>, a great OSS library. Once I had it installed, I used a <a href="https://github.com/meh/ruby-tesseract-ocr">ruby wrapper</a> to make using it easier.</p>

<p>The script eventually turned into something like:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># initialize and configure Tesseract</span>
<span class="n">engine</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Tesseract</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Engine</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">language</span>  <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">:eng</span>
  <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">blacklist</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'|'</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># iterate over artists and pull their thumbnails</span>
<span class="c1"># given the URL to a publicly accessible image at img</span>

<span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">engine</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">text_for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">img</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">gsub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/[^a-z ]/i</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">''</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">gsub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">' '</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">''</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">length</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">30</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Found problematic artist </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">artist_doc</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'last'</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
  <span class="c1"># ...</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So all we do is find all the text in an image, and then remove any garbage characters or artifacts from the OCR analysis, and then use 30 as an arbitrary cutoff to determine if an image was problematic. If the image had more than 30 characters as detected by the OCR library, we wound up unsetting it from the artist.</p>

<p>The additional logic to set artist covers from their iconic artworks was already in place, and I ran this script in production, identifying and unsetting over 1000 problematic thumbnails. And we haven’t gotten any new reports of this bug since then :)</p>

<p><em>This crash report was shortened for clarity sake, you can find the full report
<a href="https://gist.github.com/alloy/cfaab5b754fdd2c551e0">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Now, this might not be the toughest nut to crack –if you’ve been doing UIKit development for a while, you may already
know that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIScrollView</code> does not weakify it’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delegate</code>– but instead of just going by experience and making some
changes, let’s see if we can’t figure out exactly what’s happening, for the sake of reproducing and confidently making
the right fix.</p>

<p>The lines near the top of the stack trace tell me that it’s probably a message being sent to some garbage memory, i.e.
a released object, so that’s where I want to be poking around.</p>

<h3 id="getting-at-often-called-locations">Getting at often called locations</h3>

<p>So I want to get at the 2nd frame in the stack, but that method and the one at the 3rd frame get invoked <em>a lot</em> while
navigating to the view I want to debug. There’s many ways to do this, but the simple approach I often take in these
cases is to set a breakpoint for the last frame in the stack that is <em>unique to the location that I want to get at</em> and
then keep refining the breakpoints every time I hit one.</p>

<p>In this case that starts off with a breakpoint in
<a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/1.7.0/Artsy/Classes/Views/ARArtworkView.m#L85">our code</a>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(lldb) b -[ARArtworkView setUpCallbacks]
Breakpoint 1: where = Artsy`-[ARArtworkView setUpCallbacks] + 19 at ARArtworkView.m:101, address = 0x000000010e722853
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With that set I then navigate to the view I want to get at and, once the breakpoint is hit, set the breakpoint for a
frame that’s even closer to the location I want to get at:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Process 74926 stopped

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And finally I repeat the process and set the breakpoint that I <em>really</em> want to get to:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(lldb) b -[UIScrollView _getDelegateZoomView]

<p>By this point, I’m left with the realization that I don’t have a device running iOS 8.1.x anymore –the above was all on
the simulator– and thus jumping through the code in a debugger on a device is not going to be reliable. Instead, I’m
going to take a look at the disassembly and (pseudo) decompiled code in <a href="http://www.hopperapp.com">Hopper</a> –a tool I
highly suggest you go and buy <strong>right now</strong>, it’s ridiculously cheap for the amount of time it will save you–.</p>

<p>To be able to do so, though, I first had to get a copy of UIKit for one of the devices of which we received crash logs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Firmware decryption keys</strong>: keys for many variants are listed
<a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Firmware_Keys">here</a>. If the model you need is not listed you’ll have to manually
figure out the key, which is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Download firmware</strong>: you can find links for all variants on
<a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Firmware">this page</a>. I chose iOS 8.1.2 for the 2nd revision of the iPhone 5
(iPhone 5,2), because the keys to decrypt that are known and it’s one of the devices and OS versions for which we had
received crash reports.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Decrypt image</strong>: there are a bunch of tools that allow you to decrypt firmware images, which are listed
<a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Category:Decryption">here</a>. I’m using
<a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Dmg_(command)">xpwn’s ‘dmg’ tool</a> which you can get from
<a href="https://github.com/planetbeing/xpwn/tree/master/dmg">planetbeing’s GitHub repo</a>. Once you’ve got the key from
<a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Firmware_Keys">here</a>, or have otherwise manually figured it out, you can decrypt
the disk image like so:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ unzip -d iPhone5,2_8.1.2 iPhone5,2_8.1.2_12B440_Restore.ipsw

</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Extract UIKit from shared DYLD cache</strong>: for performance reasons, Apple decided to create one big cache that
contains all of the commonly used frameworks, including UIKit. To get just UIKit, you’ll need to use any of the tools
listed <a href="http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Dyld_shared_cache#Cache_extraction">here</a>, I used
<a href="https://github.com/kennytm/Miscellaneous/downloads">dyld_decache</a>:</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ open decrypted.dmg

<p>With that out of the way, I can finally load that up in Hopper and look at the instruction. I can get the offset of
the instruction from the stack frame, specifically the ‘66’ in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-[UIScrollView _getDelegateZoomView] + 66</code>. This means that the instruction’s address is that of the function it is
located in <em>plus</em> 66, which, as you can see in the below screenshot, is halfway through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">objc_msgSend</code> call:</p>

<p><a href="/images/2015-07-30-Notorious-BUG-1/Hopper-Disassembled.png">
  <img src="/images/2015-07-30-Notorious-BUG-1/Hopper-Disassembled.png" alt="The assembly of the `-[UIScrollView _getDelegateZoomView]` method." style="" />
</a></p>

<p>If you want to get into the details of what these instructions are doing, I suggest you read up on a blog post such as
<a href="https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2011-12-30-disassembling-the-assembly-part-3-arm-edition.html">this article by Mike Ash</a>.
The important part here is that you can easily see that it’s all related to sending the following message to the scroll
view’s delegate:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(viewForZoomingInScrollView:)]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hopper can give us (pseudo) decompiled code for this method, which looks like the following:</p>

<p><a href="/images/2015-07-30-Notorious-BUG-1/Hopper-Decompiled.png">
  <img src="/images/2015-07-30-Notorious-BUG-1/Hopper-Decompiled.png" alt="The pseudo-code of the `-[UIScrollView _getDelegateZoomView]` method." style="" />
</a></p>

<p>Based on that, it’s clear to see that that’s what happens and so it’s the delegate that points to garbage, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x10</code> in
this crash report to be specific.</p>

<h3 id="simulating-the-crash">Simulating the crash</h3>

<p>Now that I know what’s happening, it’s time to simulate the crash on the Simulator so that I can confidently make the
fix for what I think is going wrong.</p>

<p>Based on the above, I now know that, on the Simulator, this crash would occur around the 16th instruction, which is
where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-respondsToSelector:</code> message gets sent, so I’ll jump to just before it, but <em>after</em> where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delegate</code>
variable would get set:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(lldb) disassemble --frame

<p>At this instruction, the object to which the message will be sent has been assigned to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$rdi</code> register, which in my
case is still the expected and valid object:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(lldb) po $rdi
&lt;ARArtworkViewController: 0x7fc99c9681d0&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point I can just override the register with the garbage shown in the crash report:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(lldb) register write rdi 0x10
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And finally continue execution and let the crashing occur:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(lldb) bt

<p>💥</p>

<p>Perfect, an exact replica of the crash report, so now I know with confidence that the problem is that the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARArtworkViewController</code> is released by the time that method is called.</p>

<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3>

<p>The fix for this crash is simple and not really interesting for this post, as it’s all about the steps I took to arrive
there. I think these are way more interesting, as you can apply some/all of these in many different situations.</p>

<p>But for completeness sake, the fix is to make sure that <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/356b88d1ff035a9f0aa28f19e42255c7152a88f4/Artsy/View_Controllers/Artwork/ARArtworkViewController.m#L28">the scroll view’s delegate gets nillified</a>
before the view controller is released and <em>in addition</em> it lead to me figuring out why the scroll view was still even
alive at that time, which was <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/commit/8db7b1e75563ee2ee7b547223cb02e1e646e7bd8">a block retention-cycle</a>.</p>
