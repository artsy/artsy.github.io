    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to talk about a pattern that we’ve been using for the last few years on the Artsy Mobile team. This pattern pre-dates me joining Artsy by a few weeks, and was introduced into our codebase by <a href="http://90wpm.com">Ben Jackson</a>, this was the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRouter</code>’s first method:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Yep, that’s pre-ARC, pre-Dictionary Literals, memory-managed code. We took this pattern and rolled with it for the next 4 years, this article is about where we’ve taken it.</p>

<p>Within Eigen, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRouter</code> is one of our <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/904e8abfc11ce6ea4b6e81f0e02684b755a280c3/Artsy/Networking/ARRouter.m">biggest classes</a>, coming in at almost 1,000 lines of code. Whereas in Energy, it sits at a <a href="https://github.com/artsy/energy/blob/e51529250ede359c781042f222d5836eb9e8a979/Classes/Util/App/ARRouter.m">more reasonable</a> 300 lines. Eidolon does not have an ARRouter, what gives?</p>

<h2 id="pattern-evolution">Pattern Evolution</h2>

<p>We started out with a Router object as being something that can take a model object, and return a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSURL</code> corresponding to a server side end-point.</p>

<p>This worked pretty well, we shipped a 1.0 of Energy with this pattern. However, it become obvious that we were putting a lot of extra knowledge about the type and the parameters of request into classes whose responsibility was not generating a route. For example, user account creation, and user account deletion would use the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSURL</code> but have different HTTP methods.</p>

<p>We migrated our networking stack to using AFNetworking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.0</code>, and started using CocoaPods instead of manually dragging and dropping code. With this in mind, we improved on the pattern and started returning <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSURLRequest</code>s which better encapsulate the server end-point request we were trying to map in the Router.</p>

<p>The pattern evolved when mixed with a <a href="http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/AFNetworking/1.3.4/Classes/AFHTTPClient.html">AFHTTPClient</a> to act as the base URL resolver, allowing us to easily switch between staging and production environments, and as a central point for hosting all HTTP headers. This meant it was trivial to generate authenticated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSURLRequest</code>s.</p>

<p>As it is presently, this pattern is working. We’ve just wrapped up a new Pod, <a href="https://github.com/artsy/Artsy_Authentication">Artsy Authentication</a>. It’s a library that has an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRouter</code> that behaves <a href="https://github.com/artsy/Artsy_Authentication/blob/master/Pod/Classes/ArtsyAuthenticationRouter.h">exactly like above</a>. We continue to build new apps with the pattern.</p>

<h2 id="siblings">Siblings</h2>

<p>This pattern is standing the test of time, but that doesn’t mean we’re not actively trying to experiment within the domain. There are three interesting offshoots from our work on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRouter</code> that are worth talking about.</p>

<h4 id="got-the-routes-like-swagger">Got the Routes like Swagger</h4>

<p>The difference between Eigen’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRouter</code> and Energy’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRouter</code> is pretty simple. Eigen’s networking scope is an order of magnitude larger. This is a reflection on the varied data that Eigen is interested in, while Energy has a tight scope on specifically Artsy Parter related data.</p>

<p>During the new year of 2015, I explored the <a href="https://github.com/orta/GotTheRoutesLikeSwagger">idea of programmatically generating</a> an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRouter</code> as a CocoaPod, and then using CocoaPods’ subspecs to make it easy to define what collections of end-points you were interested in. This project is based on a standard in which an API is documented, <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>. This meant as an API consumer, I can generate the types of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSURLRequest</code>s I would require from the API itself. It created files that looked like:</p>

<div class="language-objc highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Generated by Routes Like Swagger - 31/12/14</span>

<span class="k">@interface</span> <span class="nc">ARRouter</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nl">User</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">/// Retrieve a user by id.</span>
<span class="c1">/// @return URLRequest for /api/v1/user/{id}.{format}</span>

<span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NSURLRequest</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">getUserWithID</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">NSString</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">slug</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">/// Update an existing user.</span>
<span class="c1">/// @return URLRequest for /api/v1/user/{id}.{format}</span>

<span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NSURLRequest</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">updateUserWithID</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">NSString</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">slug</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">...</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nf">snip</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">...</span>

<span class="k">@end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This was a pretty nice expansion of the pattern, but overall felt a bit over-engineered and so, it was left as just an experiment.</p>

<h4 id="moya">Moya</h4>

<p>When we started an entirely fresh application, we noted down all the networking-related pain points felt from Eigen and Energy. The Router pattern was pretty good, but we were finding that we were having problems with the API consuming part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSURLRequest</code>s. Mainly, a difficulty in testing, an inconsistency in how we would perform networking and that it didn’t feel declarative.</p>

<p>Moya is our attempt at fixing this. I won’t go into depth on what Moya is, we’ve <a href="/blog/2014/09/22/transparent-prerequisite-network-requests/">written articles</a> on this already. The part that is interesting is that it obviates an ARRouter by using a collection of Swift enums - forcing developers to include all necessary metadata an an end-point.</p>

<h4 id="hal-and-api-v2">HAL, and API v2</h4>

<p>The Router pattern relies on the idea that you know all the routes ahead of time, and add support for them as you build out each part of the app. <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL, a Hypermedia Application Layer</a> - can be approximated as being a self describing API. dB. wrote about it in <a href="/blog/2014/09/12/designing-the-public-artsy-api/">this blog post</a>.</p>

<p>This means that you ask the API how to get certain bits of data, and it will describe the ways in which you can access it.</p>

<p>Artsy’s future APIs are using this, and the Router pattern is, more or less, totally deprecated in this world. This is what an artwork’s JSON data looks like in v2:</p>

<p>You can see that via the _links section, curies and self-referential urls, you can build network client which traverses the API without built-in implicit knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s a really exciting pattern, and as client developers, we can work on improving standard API clients that work on all HAL APIs. Instead of something specific to Artsy’s API. A lot of the most interesting work in the Cocoa space has been done by Kyle Fuller with <a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/Hyperdrive">Hyperdrive</a>.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h3>

<p>Given that we’re not writing applications against the v2 API, yet. The Router pattern is working fine for us at Artsy. It can be a really nice way to abstract out a responsibility that may currently be sitting inside a very large API client that might be worth extracting out.</p>
