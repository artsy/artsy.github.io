    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past week has found me working on a brand new Rails project. Now, if I was building this project for my personal needs, I would without a doubt deploy it to <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> – for both the ease of use and the high level of abstraction that <a href="https://www.heroku.com/dynos">Dynos</a> afford. But I'm not building this for myself, I'm building it for my team.</p>

<p>While Heroku is easy to get started with, costs scale up quickly. And, as described in our <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/04/14/artsy-technology-stack-2017/">2017 tech stack post</a>, our team is moving more and more towards <a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a>. I had almost no experience with Kubernetes before last week, and I was intimidated by the Kubernetes web UI. With some help from my colleague Isac, who wrote the <a href="https://github.com/artsy/hokusai">Hokusai</a> tool, I was able to get a staging environment up and running in under a day.</p>

<p>But let's step back first.</p>

<p>My background is in iOS software development, so spinning up new servers isn't something I do often. When I <em>do</em>, I usually use Heroku. After deploying to it, it feels like Kubernetes is a kind of hosted Heroku: it handles scaling up instances, managing worker/db/other instances, load-balancers, environment variables, promoting from staging to production – all that stuff. But Kubernetes' sophistication comes with a sophisticated user interface.</p>

<p>So basically, Hokusai is to Kubernetes what the Heroku command-line tool is to the Heroku platform.</p>

<p>Hokusai provides <a href="https://github.com/artsy/hokusai/blob/master/docs/Command_Reference.md">a bunch of commands</a> for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster. Deploying my new Rails app to Kubernetes involved a few steps, but most of the work was handled automatically by Hokusai.</p>

<p>First, I installed and setup Hokusai locally (with required environment variables for AWS access). I then ran the following command to scaffold out everything.</p>

<pre><code class="sh">hokusai setup --aws-account-id ARTSY_ACCOUNT_ID --project-type ruby-rails
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to staging- and production-specific config files, this command creates a <code>Dockerfile</code>. See, where Heroku uses Dynos as a high level of abstraction, Kubernetes uses <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> images (as a slightly less high a level of abstraction). Docker is a technology I'm familiar with, and I managed to configure the generated <code>Dockerfile</code> and <code>hokusai/*.yml</code> config files pretty quickly. At this point, I could run <code>hokusai dev start</code> to start a development Docker container, or <code>hokusai test</code> to run RSpec tests. Nothing fancy yet, but that verifies that everything is working so far.</p>

<p>Next up was to use Hokusai in our CI environment. <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/">Circle CI 2.0</a> is very Docker-oriented, so we set up everything using their <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/">Workflows</a>. This is a much higher level of abstraction for CI configuration than I'm used to, but I got the hang of it quickly. I created a job to run RSpec tests through Hokusai, a job to run <a href="http://danger.systems">Danger</a>, a job to build and push a Docker image to our S3 bucket, and a job to deploy that image to the Kubernetes cluster. Finally, I added the workflows to build and deploy automatically after successful builds on the <code>master</code> branch.</p>

<p>Here's a slightly redacted copy of our Circle config:</p>

<pre><code class="yaml">version: 2
jobs:
  test:
    docker:
      - image: artsy/hokusai:0.4.0
    working_directory: ~/REPO_NAME
    steps:
      - add_ssh_keys
      - checkout
      - setup_remote_docker
      - run:
          name: Test
          command: hokusai test
  danger:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.5.0
    working_directory: ~/apogee
    steps:
      - checkout
      - restore_cache:
          keys:
          - v1-dependencies-
          - v1-dependencies-
      - run:
          name: Install Dependencies
          command: bundle install --with=ci --without development test --path vendor/bundle
      - save_cache:
          paths:
            - ./vendor/bundle
          key: v1-dependencies-
      - run:
          name: Danger
          command: bundle exec danger

    steps:
      - add_ssh_keys
      - checkout
      - setup_remote_docker
      - run:
          name: Push
          command: hokusai registry push --tag $CIRCLE_SHA1 --force --overwrite
  deploy:
    docker:
      - image: artsy/hokusai:0.4.0
    steps:
      - add_ssh_keys
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Configure
          command: hokusai configure --kubectl-version 1.6.3 --s3-bucket BUCKET_NAME --s3-key k8s/config --platform linux
      - run:
          name: Deploy
          command: hokusai staging deploy $CIRCLE_SHA1
workflows:
  version: 2
  default:
    jobs:
      - test
      - danger:
          filters:
            branches:
              ignore: master
      - push:
          filters:
            branches:
              only: master
          requires:
            - test
      - deploy:
          filters:
            branches:
              only: master
          requires:
            - push
</code></pre>

<p>The initial build on <code>master</code> built and pushed the server image, but the deploy failed. This is an <a href="https://github.com/artsy/hokusai/issues/50">issue</a> that's being tracked in Hokusai – I'm sure it'll get addressed on the road to a 1.0. To explain, it's a Catch-22: we can't deploy until we have an image, but we only want to build images on CI, so the first deploy on CI is expected to fail.</p>

<p>Once the initial image was pushed, I ran <code>hokusai staging env create</code> locally to create the staging environment. I was able to set staging environment variables using <code>hokusai staging env set NAME=VALUE</code>, but unlike Heroku, I had to manually restart the server using <code>hokusai staging refresh</code> after adding the environment variables.</p>

<p>At this point, my server was working behind a load balancer, but I still had to add a CNAME record for the <code>really-long-url.elb.amazonaws.com</code> domain name. After some DNS propagation, everything worked fine!</p>

<p>So that's it! I was apprehensive about moving to a totally new (to me) deploy infrastructure. But, it's a direction our engineering team has decided to go in, and there's no better time to migrate to a new deploy infrastructure than before your first deploy. With some encouragement and help from my team, I was able to get the entire thing working in under a day (next time will be a lot faster).</p>

<p>I'm very encouraged by Kubernetes. It offers really slick, enterprise-level scaling features in an open source tool. And I've heard really great things about its community practices. Kubernetes is, however, a very specialized tool and its web interface doesn't make any sense to me. With Hokusai, I got a very programmer-friendly interface for a very DevOps-focused tool.</p>
