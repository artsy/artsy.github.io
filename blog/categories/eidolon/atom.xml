<p>Swift became public in June 2014, by August we had started using it in Artsy. By October, we had <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/">Swift in production</a> channelling hundreds of thousands of dollars in auction bids.</p>

<p>It is pretty obvious that Swift is the future of native development on Apple platforms. It was a no-brainer to then build an <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emergence">Apple TV app</a> in Swift, integrated Swift-support into our key app Eigen and built non-trivial parts of that <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/08/09/the-tech-behind-live-auction-integration/">application in Swift</a>.</p>

<p>We first started experimenting with React Native in February 2016, and by August 2016, we announced that <a href="/blog/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/">Artsy moved to React Native</a> effectively meaning new code would be in JavaScript from here onwards.</p>

<p>We’re regularly asked <em>why</em> we moved, and it was touched on briefly in our announcement but I’d like to dig in to this and try to cover a lot of our decision process. So, if you’re into understanding why a small team of iOS developers with decades of native experience switched to JavaScript, read on.</p>

<p>This post will cover: <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#What.are.Artsy.s.apps.">What are Artsy’s apps?</a>, Swifts <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#Swift.s.upsides">positives</a> and <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#Native.Downsides">negatives</a> for us, <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#React.Native">React Native</a>, and our <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#React.Native..one.year.later">1-year summary</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We were finding that our current patterns of building apps were not scaling as the team and app scope grew. Building anything inside Eigen rarely re-used existing native code, and progressively took longer to build features. Our app and test target build times were increasing, till eventually it would take 2 iOS engineers to build a feature in a similar time-frame as a single web engineer. Our iOS engineers have a lot of experience across many platforms, are well versed in best practices and understand the value of building better tools to make it faster. We had the knowledge, but we weren’t finding ourselves in a great position product development wise.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://github.com/artsy/mobile/issues/22">March 2015</a>, we gave up trying to keep pace with the web.</p>

<p>Once we came to this conclusion, our discussion came to “what can we do to fix this?” Over the course of the 2015 winter break we explored ideas on how we could write more re-usable code.</p>

<h1 id="what-are-artsys-apps">What are Artsy’s apps?</h1>

<p>We have different apps with different trade-offs.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen">Eigen</a> is an app where we take JSON data from the server, and convert it into a user interface. Each view controller can nearly always be described as a function taking data and mapping it to a UI. <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon">Eidolon</a> (our Auctions Kiosk app) which contains a lot of Artsy-wide unique business logic which is handled with local state like card reader input, or unique user identification modes. <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emergence">Emergence</a> is a trivial-ish tvOS app which has a few view controllers, and is mostly handled by Xcode’s storyboards.</p>

<p><a href="/images/emission/eigen.svg" style="">
  <img src="/images/emission/eigen.svg" alt="Eigen separated into app + components" style="" />
</a></p>

<p>Eigen is where we worried about how we were building apps, other apps are limited in their scope, but Eigen is basically the mobile representation of Artsy. We’re never <em>not</em> going to have something like Eigen.</p>

<p>We eventually came to the conclusion that we needed to re-think our entire UIKit stack for Eigen. Strictly speaking, Objective-C was not a problem for us, our issues came from abstractions around the way we built apps.</p>

<p>Re-writing from scratch was not an option. That takes <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">a lot of time and effort</a>, which will happily remove technical debt, but that’s not our issue. We also don’t need or have a big redesign. However, a lot of companies used the Objective-C -&gt; Swift transition as a time to re-write from scratch. We asked for the experiences from developers who had opted to do this, they said it was a great marketing tool for hiring - but was a lot of pain to actually work with day to day. They tend to talk about technical debt, and clean slates - but not that Objective-C was painful and Swift solves major architectural problems. With the notable exception of functional programming purists.</p>

<p>In the end, for Eigen, we came to the conclusion that we wanted to work with a component-based architecture. This architectural choice comes from studying how other larger apps handle code-reuse.</p>

<p>We were considering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>View Controllers being a mix of Components which could be extended using protocols in Swift.</li>
  <li>JSON defined Components ( which would have ended up like Spotify’s (<a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/HubFramework">hub</a>) or Hyperslo’s (<a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/Spots">Spots</a>) ).</li>
  <li>Building a Component structure heavily inspired by React ( like Bending Spoons’s (<a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/Katana">Katana</a>) ).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="swifts-upsides">Swift’s upsides</h1>

<p>Had we continued with native apps via native code, we’d have put more resources behind Swift, which had quite a bit running for it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It was consistent with our existing code.</strong> We wrote hundreds of thousands of lines of code in Objective-C and maybe around a hundred thousand of Swift. The majority of the team had 5+ years of Cocoa experience and no-one needs to essentially argue that <em>continuing</em> with that has value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Swift code can interact with Objective-C and can work on its own.</strong> We can write Swift libraries that can build on-top of our existing infrastructure to work at a higher level of abstraction. Building a component-based infrastructure via Swift could allow easy-reuse of existing code, while providing a language difference for “new app code” vs “infra.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>People are excited about Swift.</strong> It’s an interesting, growing language, and one of the few ones non-technical people ask about. “Oh you’re an iOS developer, do you use Swift?” is something I’ve been asked a lot. The developers outside of the mobile team have signed up multiple times for Swift workshops and want to know what Swift is, and what its trade-offs are.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It’s evolving</strong> the language changes at a fast rate, with new ideas coming from, and influencing other languages. People inside the community influence and shape its growth. There are some great claims being made <a href="https://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/565001293975257091">about Swift</a> by people we respect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Swift improves on a lot of Objective-C.</strong> Most of the patterns that we use in Objective-C are verbose, and they can become extremely terse inside Swift. Potentially making it easier to read and understand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>We would be using the official route.</strong> Apple obviously <em>wants</em> you to be using Swift, they are putting a <em>lot</em> of resources into the language. There are smart people working on the project, and it’s become more stable and useful every year. There aren’t any <em>Swift-only</em> APIs yet, but obviously they’ll be coming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">known-unknown</a> territory.</strong> We have a lot of knowledge around building better tooling for iOS apps. From libraries like <a href="https://github.com/moya/moya">Moya</a>, to foundational projects like <a href="https://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a>. Coming up with, and executing dramatic tooling improvements is possible. Perhaps we had overlooked a smarter abstraction which would have worked around the downsides, and thus making it worth expanding our search.</p>

    <p>If we end up building something which gains popularity, we get the advantage of working with a lot of fresh perspectives, and being able to gain from other people working on the same project. This is what happened with <a href="https://github.com/moya/moya">Moya</a>. It’s a pattern Basecamp discuss when they <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/660-ask-37signals-the-genesis-and-benefits-of-rails">talk about rails</a> by beginning with a real project and abstracting outwards.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="native-downsides">Native Downsides</h1>

<p>The dominant two issues come from differences in opinions in how software should be built</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Types.</strong> Types are useful. Overly strict typing systems make it too hard to <em>quickly</em> change codebases.</p>

    <p>Strictly typed languages work <em>really</em> well for <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2014/10/14/hypothetical-objective-c-3-0/#comment-2177091">building systems</a>, or completely atomic apps - the sort Apple have to build on a day to day basis. When I say an atomic app, I mean one where the majority of the inputs and outputs exist within the domain of the application. Think of apps with their own filetypes, that can control inputs and outputs really easily.</p>

    <p>Even in Objective-C, a looser-typed language where you were not discouraged from using meta–programming, handling JSON required <em>a tonne</em> of boilerplate laden, inelegant code when working with an API. Considering how bread-and-butter working with an API is for most 3rd party developers it should come as no surprise that the most popular CocoaPods are about handling JSON parsing, and making network requests.</p>

    <p>Problems which Apple, generally speaking, don’t have. They use iCloud, or CloudKit, or whatever, and expect you will also. The official Apple opinion was neatly summed up on the official Swift blog on how to handle JSON parsing <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=37">exhibits the problem well</a>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Swift’s built-in language features make it easy to safely extract and work with JSON data decoded with Foundation APIs — without the need for an external library or framework.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>They do, but it’s not great code to write nor maintain. I don’t know anyone who does what they recommend in production.</p>

    <p>The stricter type system in Swift made it harder to work on JSON-driven apps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Slow.</strong> Native development when put next to web development is slow. Application development requires full compilation cycles, and full state restart of the application that you’re working on. A trivial string change in Eigen takes <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/778242899821621249">25 seconds</a> to show up. When I tell some developers that time, they laugh and say I have it good.</p>

    <center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Making a single edit in a string takes 25 seconds to see the difference in the swift parts of Eigen <a href="https://t.co/MOPGPEWqxX">pic.twitter.com/MOPGPEWqxX</a></p>&mdash; 💍rta Therox (@orta) <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/778242899821621249">September 20, 2016</a></blockquote></center>

    <p>The moment that this really stood out for me was when I <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/271559616888967168">re</a>-discovered <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/705890397810257921">Injection for Xcode</a> which ruined my appetite for building apps the traditional way. It reduced an iteration cycle to about <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/706165678177390592">a second</a>. With Apple’s resources, and the fact that Injection for Xcode has existed for years by a single developer, it’s frustrating that iOS is a <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/index.html#instant-run">mobile platform</a> with no support for code reloading. I filed bug reports (<a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/8796">radars</a>), they were marked as duped with no comment. I talked to Apple engineers at WWDC, the idea was dismissed as “didn’t work” when it was <a href="http://stpeterandpaul.ca/tiger/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/XcodeUserGuide/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/06_06_db_fix_and_continue/chapter_44_section_1.html">tried before</a>.</p>

    <p>I’ve heard developers say they use Playgrounds to work around some of these problems, and the Kickstarter app has probably the closest I’ve seen to an <a href="https://github.com/kickstarter/ios-oss/tree/master/Kickstarter-iOS.playground/Pages">actual implementation of this</a>, so check that out if you’re hitting these issues.</p>

    <p>The Swift compiler is slow. Yes, it will improve. One of my favourite Swift features, inferred typing, can accidentally increase compile times non-obviously. Which can make it feel arbitrary about what code takes longer to compile or not. We eventually <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/pull/1465">automated having our CI warn us</a> whether the code we were adding was slow as it felt hard to predict.</p>

<h1 id="react-native">React Native</h1>

<p>You may want to read our announcement of switching to <a href="/blog/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/">React Native</a> in anticipation of this. However the big three reasons are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better developer experience.</li>
  <li>Same conceptual levels as the rest of the team.</li>
  <li>Ownership of the whole stack.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the key part of this post is how does this compare to native development? Also, have these arguments stood up to the test of time a year later?</p>

<p><em>Sidenote:</em> I found it hard to write this without being able to comprehensively reference what we are doing now, and so, I’ll be referencing a sibling article: <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/">JS 2017</a>.</p>

<h3 id="developer-experience">Developer Experience</h3>

<p>The JavaScript ecosystem cares about how someone using the tool will feel. This is a part of what separates the good from the great in the community. It’s not enough to just provide a great API, and comprehensive documentation but it should substantially improve the way you work.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As <em>everyone</em> inside the community has both the ability and the tools to contribute to the ecosystem you get better tools.</p>

<p>Apple make <em>great</em> tools. I do miss Xcode sometimes. It’s cohesive, beautifully designed and doesn’t show its age. It’s a perfect Mac citizen.</p>

<p>Though it’s important to note that they make tools for Apple first and then for us 3rd party devs. Outside influence obviously exists, but they’re shipping whatever <em>they</em> want and you can only influence that via Radars and through going to a conference once a year and talking directly to the dev tools team. Only the Swift language is Open Source (and <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager">SwiftPM</a>)</p>

<p>There are so few well built, large developer tools for the Apple ecosystem. Developers are wary <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/608013279433138176">of</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattt/status/473544723118837760">being copied by Apple</a> - something so prevalent that there is a common word for it, being <a href="https://www.cocoanetics.com/2011/06/on-getting-sherlocked/">Sherlocked</a>. The project I’ve worked on for 5 years, CocoaPods, had an announcement of being sherlocked in late-2015 - you just have to deal with it. The idea that only Apple should be shipping these kind of things kills community momentum.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Alfred, Dropbox, Snapchat, Parse, OpenGL, Objective-C… <br /><br />Quite the body count this WWDC.</p>&mdash; Mattt (@mattt) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattt/status/473544723118837760">June 2, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>If you’re going to build something amazing, only to have all support pulled out from under you once it gets popular because Apple copied it and made it for free and with a full time team behind it - why bother?</p>

<p>This makes it tough for us, as the 3rd party community, to build useful tools on the kind of scale that is normal in other developer ecosystems.</p>

<p>This contrasts drastically with the JavaScript ecosystem, check out my explanation of Jest - and compare Jest to either Quick or Specta. Then remind yourself that only Apple has the power to do most of what Jest does.</p>

<h3 id="better-abstractions-better-developer-experience">Better Abstractions, Better Developer Experience</h3>

<p>I’ve mentioned that the apps we build have problems specific to API-driven applications. This means that the majority of our work tends to be that we have the full data already, and need to iterate to get the right styling and logic mapping correct, in doing so we want to also make it easy to re-use code.</p>

<p>The React component-oriented architecture makes it very easy to build these types of applications. Born out of the <a href="/blog/2016/11/14/JS-Glossary/#javascript-fatigue">JavaScript primordial soup</a>, where conceptual frameworks come and go every year or so. React has been around for a while now, and seems to have a lot of momentum.</p>

<p>All of these frameworks have the same domain problems that our iOS apps have, external API stores, complex user device state and a mature user-interface API (either the DOM, or UIKit.)</p>

<p>With React, the core concept of a virtual DOM means that you can simplify a lot of complicated state-management for your application. It becomes trivial, removing the need for more complicated state-handling ideas like functional or reactive programming.</p>

<p>With Relay, we got an genuinely ground-breaking change in how interactions get handled with our API. I don’t want to  work against an API without a tool like Relay again.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>References from JS 2017: <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#React...React.Native">React</a>, <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#Relay">Relay</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both of these tools provide a developer experience better than iOS native tooling. React’s strict state management rules allow external tools to extend a React application easily, so the onus is not on the React team to make better tools. Other projects provide tools like: <a href="https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger">debuggers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron">external state viewers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader">runtime code injection</a>, <a href="https://github.com/storybooks/react-storybook">component storyboarding</a> all of which can be running simultaneously as you are building your application. Imagine being given the flow of all state in your app in <a href="https://logrocket.com">every bug report</a>.</p>

<p>A single press of save would take your changes, inject it into your current running application, keep you in the exact same place, depending on the type of change it could re-layout your views, and so you can stay in your editor and make your changes. <em>From 25 seconds, to less than one</em>. For a lot of my work, I can put my tests, debuggers and the application on another screen, and just move my head to watch changes propagate on pressing save.</p>

<p>So, you’re thinking <em>“Yeah, but JavaScript…“</em> - well, we use <a href="http://typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> and it fixes pretty much every issue with JavaScript. It’s also no problem for us to write native code when we need to, we are still adding to an existing native codebase. The last project I did on our React Native codebase required bi-directional JS &lt;-&gt; Swift communication.</p>

<p>React Native feels like the best of both worlds: Elegant, fast to work with application code, which the whole dev team understands. Falling back to native tooling when we think it will be best for the project.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There’s one more thing that I want to really stress around developer experience, it’s really easy to write tests for our React components. Testing in JavaScript is night-and-day better than native testing. Because we can run our tests outside of the simulator (due to React’s virtual DOM) we run tests whenever you press save. These tests are only the ones related to the current <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#Jest">changes in git</a>. The only thing we miss is visual snapshots <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/15-testing/snapshot-testing/">from the simulator</a>, not having to restart a simulator to run tests makes it worth it though.</p>

<h4 id="same-tools-different-dev">Same Tools, Different Dev</h4>

<p>We wanted to stop being highly unique inside the dev team. Artsy has around 25 developers, the majority of which work with Ruby and JavaScript on a day-to-day basis. The mobile team was the single development team that didn’t make their own API changes, used different toolchains and were much slower in shipping anything.</p>

<p>This isn’t a great position to be in.</p>

<p>We wanted all developers to feel like they can contribute to any area of the company. For the past 5 years, the native mobile projects had close to zero contributions from anyone outside of the mobile team. Due to differences in tooling, and the idea that there was a cultural difference between us. Since the mobile team moved to React Native we have received features and bug fixes from the web team, and fit in better overall.</p>

<p>This expansion of a mobile team developer’s scope has made it much easier for us to reason about finding better ways to share code with the web team. At the end of 2015, the Collector Web team introduced GraphQL to Artsy. I wrote about how this affected the <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/06/19/graphql-for-mobile/">mobile team</a>. This acts as an API layer owned by the front-end side of Artsy. Meaning that it could contain a lot of API-derived client-specific logic. Previously, this work was done by the web team, and then consumed by mobile - now both teams build their APIs and consume them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reference from JS 2017: <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#GraphQL">GraphQL</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not something we have explored too deeply, however we expect to be able to port a lot of our React Native to Android. I got a rough prototype ported in 2 days work. By working at React-level, and allowing the React Native bindings to handle the interactions with the host OS, we’ve been writing cross-platform code.</p>

<p>We consider ourselves blocked on Android support, specifically by not having an engineer in our team with <em>deep</em> experience in Android. Moving to React Native does not obviate our native skills, you’re going to be significantly better in that environment with those skills than without. As we mentioned in our <a href="/blog/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/">announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re not already knowledgeable about iOS development, are not motivated to put in the time to learn about the
  platform specific details, and think making rich iOS applications with React Native will be a breeze, you’ll
  <a href="http://www.dwotd.nl/2008/06/443-van-een-kouwe-kermis-thuiskomen.html">come home from a very cold fair</a> indeed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need someone with a similar depth of knowledge in the Android ecosystem as our iOS, but we may need one or two for the entire team. The rest can continue to be a mix of Web and iOS engineers. You gain a subset of cross-platform skills using React Native. Had we continued down the path of using Swift, our skills would continue to be siloed.</p>

<p>There is an argument that Swift will be running servers soon, and so you can re-use Swift code across platforms. I could see myself writing server-side back-end code in Swift (you’re writing systems, not apps) but it has a <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/swift-on-linux/">long way to go</a>. It also isn’t an argument towards using it in our native apps, we’d have to re-write servers and implement our own GraphQL and Relay stack. This also would not impact the front-end code for the web - they would still be using JavaScript.</p>

<p>With respect to Swift on Android, potentially, logic code could be shared between platforms but realistically for our setup that’s just not worth it. We’re moving that kind of logic into the GraphQL instance and sharing across <em>all</em> clients, not only native platforms. If you’re sharing model code, you could generate that per-project instead from the server. Since GraphQL is strongly-typed, we’re doing this for both <a href="https://github.com/alloy/relational-theory/pull/18">TypeScript + GraphQL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alloy/vscode-relay">TypeScript + Relay</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t know where this will end, but we’ve prototyped porting one of our view controllers from React Native <a href="https://github.com/alloy/relational-theory/pull/16">to a website</a>. It’s almost source-compatible. This such a completely different mindset from where we were a year ago.</p>

<h4 id="owning-the-stack">Owning the stack</h4>

<p>Pick an abstraction level of our application above UIKit and we can fork it. All our tools can be also be forked. We can fix our own issues.</p>

<p>In native, there are no concepts like, <em>“We’ll use Steipete’s fork of UIKit for UIPopover rotation fixes”</em> or <em>“My version of Xcode will run tests when you press save.”</em>. Well, hopefully the latter <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/790589579552296966">may be fixed</a> in time, but the “you have no choice but to wait, and maybe it won’t happen” aspect is part of the problem.</p>

<p>You have your tools given to you, in a year you get some new ones and lose some old ones. In contrast, we’ve built <a href="https://github.com/orta/vscode-jest#vscode-jest-">many</a> <a href="https://github.com/orta/vscode-react-native-storybooks">extensions</a> <a href="https://github.com/alloy/vscode-relay">for</a> <a href="https://github.com/orta/vscode-ios-common-files">VS</a> <a href="https://github.com/orta/vscode-danger">Code</a> for our own use, and helped out on <a href="https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">major ones</a>. When VS Code didn’t do what I wanted, I started using <a href="https://github.com/orta/Essence">use my own fork</a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the last year, we have submitted code to major JavaScript dependencies of ours: React Native, Relay, VS Code, Jest and a few libraries in-between - fixing problems where we see them, offering features if we need them. Some of these changes are <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/12628">small</a>, but some <a href="https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/1061">are</a> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/2192">big</a> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/6114">moves</a>. Being able to help out on any problem makes it much easier to live with the <a href="/blog/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/">593 dependencies</a> that using React Native brings.</p>

<p>It’s worth highlighting that all of this is done on GitHub, in the open. We can write issues, get responses, and have direct line to the people who are working on something we depend on. This is a stark contrast to the Radar system used internally at Apple, and which external developers have write-only access to. For external contributors radar is opaque, and <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/04/13/app-developers-frustrated-with-bug-reporting-tools-call-on-apple-to-fix-radar-or-gtfo/">often feels like a waste of time</a>. On the other hand, a GitHub issue doesn’t have to wait for the repo maintainers, others can get value from it and it’s publicly indexed. If we had put all our effort into Radars instead of <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/issues/586">issues like</a> this, the whole community would be worse off.</p>

<p>This isn’t all doom and gloom. With Swift the language, and SwiftPM the package manager, Apple are more open with the feedback cycle using tools like <a href="https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160530/000497.html">Slack</a>, Mailing Lists, JIRA and Twitter.</p>

<p>One aspect of working with JavaScript that has been particularly pleasant is the idea that your language is effectively a buffet. If you want to use the latest features of the language you can opt-in to it. We’ve slowly added language features, while retaining backwards compatibility. First using <a href="https://babeljs.io">Babel</a>, then <a href="https://flowtype.org">Flow</a> and finally with <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>.</p>

<p>In contrast, and this may be the last major time it happens, but people refer to the time it took to migrate <a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/migrating-to-swift-3-7add0ce0655#.rvyrohyhq">in</a> <a href="https://tech.zalando.com/blog/app-migration-to-swift-3/">the</a> <a href="https://github.com/kickstarter/ios-oss/pull/26">scale</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/guidomb/status/817363981216129025">of</a> <em>weeks</em> during the Swift 2 -&gt; 3 migration. Having the language evolve is great, sometimes in ways that you <a href="https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/">agree with</a> and sometimes in ways <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/07/17/swift-classes-to-be-non-publicly-subclassable-by-default/">you don’t</a>. Being able to use your own version of your tools frees you to make it work for you and your business. We have been talking about <a href="/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#TypeScript-Extension">extending TypeScript</a> specifically for our applications.</p>

<h1 id="react-native-one-year-later">React Native, one year later</h1>

<p>In our announcement we talked about the lack of nuanced post-mortems on React Native. We’re now a year in, we can at least try to help out in that space. We’re sticking with React Native for the foreseeable future. It would take some <em>drastic</em> changes in the Apple ecosystem for us to re-consider this decision. So here’s the summary after 1 year.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can share concepts with web</li>
  <li>Tools are built for apps like ours</li>
  <li>To do it right requires engineers willing to dive deep in JS</li>
  <li>You need native experience to have a polished app</li>
  <li>Dependency stack is still obscenely big</li>
  <li>Opens native engineers to more projects, makes yours more welcoming to others</li>
  <li>Problems do, and will occur, but everything is fixable by forking</li>
  <li>Extensive communication with native code gets tricky to test and maintain</li>
  <li>We ended up re-using quite a lot of existing native code</li>
  <li>It makes working in native code feel more like a chore, as you lose the JS developer experience</li>
  <li>Spending so much time in another environment will erode native knowledge</li>
  <li>Makes a lot of sense in an <a href="/blog/2016/08/24/On-Emission/">additive approach</a> to existing apps</li>
  <li>We’re not making plans to re-write other Apps into React Native, they are fine as-is</li>
  <li>New apps going forward we will default to React Native apps, unless there is a good reason to not</li>
</ul>

<p>So, should you use React Native? Maybe. If you have an API driven app, <em>probably.</em></p>

<p>It’s definitely worth a week of prototyping for any engineering team, then if that goes well you should look into GraphQL and Relay. They really make React Native shine.</p>

<h1 id="want-to-get-started">Want to get started?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Here’s the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">official site</a>.</li>
  <li>These <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/react-native-fundamentals">two</a> <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-react-native-todo-application">series</a> are high-quality. I studied JavaScript by watching hours of egghead videos.</li>
  <li>Run through the <a href="https://github.com/fbsamples/f8app/">f8 app</a> series on  <a href="http://makeitopen.com/">makeitopen.com</a>.</li>
  <li>Clone our React Native app, <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/">Emission</a>.</li>
  <li>Read the rest of our <a href="/series/react-native-at-artsy/">series on React Native</a>.</li>

    <updated>2016-10-08T12:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/10/08/eidolon-deploy-process</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since we <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/">originally built</a> Eidolon – an auction bidding kiosk app – the project has largely remained in maintenance mode. Eidolon was one of the first projects that we used automated deploys for, and the deploy process has remained largely unchanged. I believe this stability of the deploy process is a testament to how well the automated deploys have gone.</p>

<p>This post is going to detail the mechanics of automated deploys for an enterprise-distributed iOS application, discuss lessons we learned and applied to other projects’ deploy processes, and describe some of the changes we’d like to make. Our project is entirely open source, so you can check out any part of the code on your own or <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/issues/new">open an issue</a> with questions.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="deploying-eidolon">Deploying Eidolon</h2>

<p>It’s one command on the terminal to deploy Eidolon:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>fast lane deploy version:X.Y.Z
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command does a lot of things. It uses <a href="https://fastlane.tools">Fastlane</a>, and you can <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/blob/a0aad31bccfe2b4abf648fc64892cc165be400b4/fastlane/Fastfile#L40-L131">read the entire script here</a>. We’re going to go over each part line-by-line. A few notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We run this command locally on a development machine that has the keys installed to sign a deploy.</li>
  <li>Our changelog is formatted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">yaml</a>, our script uses this strategically.</li>
  <li>Our deploy script modifies the project’s Info.plist version and build number, as well as the changelog.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s dive in!</p>

<h2 id="the-script">The Script</h2>

<p>The first thing we do is verify that the version number we’ve been given is in the proper <a href="http://semver.org">SemVer</a> format.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">version</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">options</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:version</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">raise</span> <span class="s2">"You must specify a version in A.B.X format to deploy."</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">version</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">nil?</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="n">version</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\d+\.\d+\.\d+/</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">length</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We deploy using Hockey, so make sure that an environment variable with the Hockey API key is set.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">hockey_api_token</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">ENV</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'HOCKEY_API_TOKEN'</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">raise</span> <span class="s2">"You must specify a HOCKEY_API_TOKEN environment variable to deploy."</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">hockey_api_token</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">nil?</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also want to verify that we have valid API keys for analytics, the Artsy API, and a few other services the app uses. This validation only makes sure the keys have been set to non-empty values. And we don’t want to accidentally deploy uncommited changes, so we check the git status first.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">verify_pod_keys</span>
<span class="n">ensure_git_status_clean</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we need to set the build number. These need to be unique, and we use the current date. This could be a problem if we need to deploy more than once in a day. It hasn’t been a problem yet, though, since we rarely deploy.</p>

<p>We also want to set the Info.plist’s version to the one specified when we run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fastlane</code> command.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">build_number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Time</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">strftime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"%Y.%m.%d"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">increment_build_number</span> <span class="ss">build_number: </span><span class="n">build_number</span>

<span class="n">increment_version_number</span> <span class="ss">version_number: </span><span class="n">version</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, now it’s time to generate markdown release notes from the changelog. Our changelog is in the following format:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">upcoming</span><span class="pi">:</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">Upcoming version bug fix.</span>

<span class="na">releases</span><span class="pi">:</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">version</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">X.Y.Z</span>
  <span class="na">date</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Month Day Year</span>
  <span class="na">notes</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">Previous version bug fix.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We want to grab the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upcoming</code> notes for the changelog, and then move them to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">releases</code> section. Let’s generate the notes first:</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">changelog_filename</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'../CHANGELOG.yml'</span>
<span class="n">changelog_yaml</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">YAML</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">load_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">changelog_filename</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">release_notes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">changelog_yaml</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'upcoming'</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">map</span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">note</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">note</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">prepend</span> <span class="s1">'- '</span> <span class="p">}.</span><span class="nf">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Updating the changelog is a little messy. I tried parsing the changelog as yaml, modifying it, and then writing it back as yaml, but kept running into trouble. Instead, I treat it as plain text. We open the changelog, split on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">releases:</code>, prepend the existing releases with a the generated release notes, and write the changelog.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">changelog_contents</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">changelog_filename</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">this_release</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">changelog_yaml</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'upcoming'</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">map</span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">note</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">note</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">prepend</span> <span class="s1">'  '</span> <span class="p">}.</span><span class="nf">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">changelog_contents</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;-</span><span class="no">EOS</span><span class="sh">

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, we’re ready to start the actual deploy process. First we need to download the provisioning profiles, which is only one step with Fastlane:</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">sigh</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we build our app using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gym</code>. We need to use the legacy build API, I can’t remember why.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">gym</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="ss">scheme: </span><span class="s2">"Kiosk"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="ss">export_method: </span><span class="s1">'enterprise'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="ss">use_legacy_build_api: </span><span class="kp">true</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With our build finished, we upload to Hockey.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">hockey</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="ss">api_token: </span><span class="n">hockey_api_token</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="ss">notes: </span><span class="n">release_notes</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, our build is deployed. Time to let the team know there’s a new version available:</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">slack</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="ss">message: </span><span class="s2">"There is a new version of the Kiosk app available. Download it at http://artsy.net/kioskbeta"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="ss">success: </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">,</span>        <span class="c1"># optional, defaults to true</span>
  <span class="ss">payload: </span><span class="p">{</span>            <span class="c1"># optional, lets you specify any number of your own Slack attachments</span>
    <span class="s1">'Version'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">version</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s1">'What\'s new'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">release_notes</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="ss">default_payloads: </span><span class="p">[],</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">default_payloads</code> needs to be empty I think, I can’t remember why. Seems like “I can’t remember why” is a common theme here…</p>

<p>Before committing the changes we’ve made to the changelog and Info.plist files, we need to clean any build artefacts. This includes the actual binary that was compiled, unit test coverage reports, and downloaded provisioning profiles.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">clean_build_artifacts</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, we commit, tag the build, and push to GitHub. Fastlane’s built-in commands to commit to git reject any changes except to Info.plist files, and we’ve modified the changelog, so I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sh</code> and used git directly.</p>

<div class="language-rb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">sh</span> <span class="s2">"git add .. ; git commit -m 'Deploying version </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">version</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">.'"</span>
<span class="n">add_git_tag</span> <span class="ss">tag: </span><span class="n">version</span>
<span class="n">push_to_git_remote</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And that’s it! With one terminal command, we’ve done all the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Verified version number format.</li>
  <li>Verified the local environment is set up to deploy.</li>
  <li>Verified API keys used by the app aren’t empty.</li>
  <li>Incremented the build number and version.</li>
  <li>Updated the changelog.</li>
  <li>Built and signed the app.</li>
  <li>Uploaded the build to Hockey.</li>
  <li>Posted a notification to Slack.</li>
  <li>Tagged the release and pushed to GitHub.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>Automating Eidolon deploys was one of the first automated deploys we built on Artsy’s iOS team. Now, based on Eidolon’s successful deploy process, all our iOS deploys are automated.</p>

<p>We’ve learned a few lessons.</p>

<p>First, running deploys locally is <em>so 2015</em>. Our more modern deploy processes run on continuous integration servers like Circle CI. This poses some problems around securing certificates necessary to deploy, maybe we’ll cover that in a future blog post.</p>

<p>We deploy on CI based on pushes to a specific branch, and we run our deploy script only if the unit tests pass. This is a huge incentive to keep CI green.</p>

<p>On other iOS projects, we sometimes deploy more than once a day, so we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Year.Month.Day.Hour</code> as the build number format, which is unique enough to do one deploy per hour. This is good enough for now.</p>

<p>One thing I really wish I’d done when I set up automated deploys is to document things a little better. To be honest, that’s part of the motivation to write this blog post (better late than never!).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, automating deploys for Eidolon has been a huge win. The other night, we had an emergency at an auction: the Eidolon app was no longer working and we needed a new deploy.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Guess who’s got two thumbs and forgot that their enterprise distribution certificates expire in September.<br /><br />👍this guy👍</p>&mdash; Ash vs NSThread (@ashfurrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/784548214527627266">October 8, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>From the time the team let me know about the problem to the time they had a fresh deploy with a new certificate, less than twenty minutes had passed. I issued one command and watched it do all the work for me. If I had to manually follow a set of arcane steps I hadn’t done in a long time, our team might not have had the new build in time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dependency Injection (DI) is a <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Dependency-Injection-Demystified.html">$25 word for a 5¢ idea</a>, but it’s an idea that has become wholly foundation to how I write software. I want to take a look at some of the ways our team have been using DI in Swift.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>DI users in Swift (and Objective-C) are generally in one of a few camps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="https://www.natashatherobot.com/unit-testing-swift-dependency-injection/">initializer injection</a> to provide objects with their dependencies.</li>
  <li>Use property injection (<a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/lazy-property-setup-in-swift/">with laziness even!</a>).</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject">frameworks like Swinject</a> to build dependency graphs at run time.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve used storybards or nibs before, you have probably already used property injection via IBOutlets. I actually consider initializer injection and property injection to be roughly the equivalent, just with different timing.</p>

<p>If I had to pick a favourite, I like the initializer injection because it fits appropriately with the level of dynamism Swift offers. But Swift is still <em>super</em> young and there’re lots of programming techniques to explore, so I’ve been experimenting with something new.</p>

<p>The idea is similar to initializer injection, where you provide an instance’s dependencies, but instead of providing the dependencies directly, you provide closures that return a dependency. It sounds odd, and is best explained using an example that starts without any DI at all.</p>

<p>Okay, we’ve got a network layer that communicates with an API. We’re writing the class that takes the parsed data from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NetworkProvider</code> class and turns it into models consumable by the rest of the app. Right now it looks like this.</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">StateManager</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">networkProvider</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">NetworkProvider</span>
    
    <span class="nf">init</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">networkProvider</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">NetworkProvider</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"https://api.wherever.com"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are some limitations to this, specifically around testing it. It would be better to have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">networkProvider</code> passed in as an argument to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init()</code>. That’s initializer injection, and my opposition to it is that we’ve moved the responsibility for creating the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">networkProvider</code> up the stack.</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">StateManager</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">networkProvider</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">NetworkProvider</span>
    
    <span class="nf">init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">networkProvider</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">NetworkProvider</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">networkProvider</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">networkProvider</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="o">...</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">stateManager</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">StateManager</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="nv">networkProvider</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">NetworkProvider</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"https://api.wherever.com"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The thing is, now some <em>other</em> object has to know how to do create the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NetworkProvider</code>. Hrm. You can repeat this process of injecting dependencies from further up the stack until you have a general-purpose DI framework, and that’s not my bag.</p>

<p>My approach passes a closure that <em>returns</em> a network provider instead of passing in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">networkProvider</code> instance directly. The parameter can be given a default implementation, too.</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">StateManager</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">networkProvider</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">NetworkProvider</span>
    
    <span class="nf">init</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="nv">networkProviderCreator</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">NetworkProvider</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">StateManager</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">defaultNetworkCreator</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">networkProvider</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">networkProviderCreator</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    
    <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">defaultNetworkCreator</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">(()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">NetworkProvider</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="kt">NetworkProvider</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"https://api.wherever.com"</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s a lot to unpack here, so let’s take it slowly. The initializer has a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">networkProviderCreator</code>, a closure that returns a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NetworkProvider</code>. In the initializer, we set our property to the return value of the closure. We also have a class method that gives us a default implementation that’s used in production.</p>

<p>But in tests, we can initialize the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StateManager</code> with a stub closure, something like:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">fakeNetworkProvider</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">testSubject</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">StateManager</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="n">fakeNetworkProvider</span> <span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now you get the benefits of initializer injection, but the flexibility to only use DI when you need to.</p>

<p>Note: we should still test the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defaultNetworkCreator()</code> function to make sure it works, too. Having code behave differently specifically while being tested is not generally a good idea.</p>

<p>Applying the advice on using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typealias</code> from <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/06/24/typealias-for-great-good/">my last post</a>, we can tidy our code up a little bit.</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">StateManager</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="but-wait-theres-more">But wait, there’s more!</h3>

<p>The other benefits of passing in a closure instead of an instance is that it lets the initializer customize the dependency based on other data. For example, let’s say the state manager uses an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enum</code> to differentiate between staging and production API endpoints (btw, <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/the-wrong-binary/">two-case enums are great at this</a>). How might our initializer change?</p>

<p>I really dig this. The closure to create the dependency is close to the code that uses it, but is insulated from any specific instance, so we get the benefits of using DI.</p>

<p>You could argue that picking a base URL for an API shouldn’t belong here, and you could probably convince me. But my point isn’t that this specific example is ideal, it’s that the pattern of using closures for initializer injection is pretty neat.</p>

<p>The logic to create dependencies has to go <em>somewhere</em>. I think it makes sense to keep it close to the code that actually uses the dependency, but isolated in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class</code> function so no actual instance is involved in its creation. As a result, developers get the benefits of initializer injection and none of the added cognitive overhead when writing your production code.</p>

<p>It may not be a perfect pattern (what is?) but we’ve been using it on <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon">eidolon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen">eigen</a> for nearly two years and – combined with generous use of protocols – we’ve been really happy with the results.</p>

<p>Now that I have more free time to explore the pattern, I want to take it a step further and see where it could be used outside of unit testing. It’s possible that using this approach could make all our types less tightly coupled and provide a more modular codebase.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a part of going through the design patterns we’ve found in the creation of the Artsy iOS apps, I’d like to introduce the Switchboard pattern. This evolved quite naturally out of <a href="/blog/2015/08/15/Cocoa-Architecture:-Router-Pattern/">ARRouter</a> when applied to generating view controllers instead of API requests.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="where-we-started">Where we started</h1>
<p>In what must be one of my best named commits, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b9ff28</code> aka <em>“CREATING THE VOID”</em> introduced an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARSwitchboard</code> to Eigen. Aside from this being the commit where I could finally write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[ARVoidViewController theVoid]</code> it added support for tapping an Artwork on the home-screen and going to another view controller.</p>

<p>We knew up-front that we needed to emulate the website’s URL schemes, so we needed to come up with a way to support two ways of loading up a view controller. Here’s what it looked like:</p>

<p>It shows the pattern’s humble origins quite well. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARSwitchboard</code> provides an API that any object can call, and it will handle presenting the view controller. Offering an API that can either use arbitrary URLs or model objects.</p>

<h2 id="where-the-pattern-evolved">Where the pattern evolved</h2>
<p>I initially wrote this during my “Class methods look prettier” stage. Our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARSwitchboard</code> has evolved into using instance methods, and it uses a sharedInstance. This makes writing tests for the routing extremely simple for <a href="https://github.com/artsy/energy/blob/master/ArtsyFolio%20Tests/Util/ARSwitchboardTests.m">easy use cases</a>, and possible <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/2eb00a8050a69ab2e05ffeb11a2bbdcbadf9fb7e/Artsy_Tests/App_Tests/ARSwitchBoardTests.m">for the complex</a>.</p>

<p>The pattern was established pretty well by the time it was integrated <a href="https://github.com/artsy/energy/blob/a35969d232d8309fd2aedaae35f2dbdf6d505004/Classes/Util/App/ARSwitchBoard.m">into Energy</a>. Some of it’s highlights are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The sharedInstance is <a href="https://github.com/artsy/energy/blob/a35969d232d8309fd2aedaae35f2dbdf6d505004/Classes/Util/App/ARSwitchBoard.m#L20-L31">set up</a> with some of the other singletons, from that point on it only acts on properties it owns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deals with setting up entire <a href="https://github.com/artsy/energy/blob/a35969d232d8309fd2aedaae35f2dbdf6d505004/Classes/Util/App/ARSwitchBoard.m#L229-L259">view hierarchies</a>. Not just pushing another view on to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UINavigationController</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="internal-routing">Internal Routing</h2>
<p>We try to make all view controllers that could represent a URL have two initializers; one that accepts a full model object and another that works off an ID. This means that we can provide as much context as we can initially, but can generate everything at runtime if you’ve come from a push notification or from another app.</p>

<p>We use an internal routing tool to do the heavy-lifting here, currently this is <a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/JLRoutes">JLRoutes</a> which we use to map URLs to blocks and dictionaries.</p>

<h2 id="difficulties">Difficulties</h2>
<p>With Eigen we’re trying to map the whole data-set of Artsy into a single app, which likely an architecture post of it’s own. However, one of the issues we’re having that really strains this metaphor is ambiguity in the routing system. For us this crops up in two places:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The URL <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/pull/534">routing structure</a> you’re mapping against can change.</li>
  <li>When one route could have <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/2eb00a8050a69ab2e05ffeb11a2bbdcbadf9fb7e/Artsy/App/ARSwitchBoard.m#L156">many types</a> of data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Handling routes that changes is something we ended up building an <a href="https://github.com/artsy/echo/blob/master/app/api/v1/presenters/route_presenter.rb">API for</a>. It provides a JSON package of routes and names, and Eigen updates its routing internally.</p>

<p>Having one route represent multiple <em>potential</em> view controllers is tricky. We didn’t want to introduce asynchronicity to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARSwitchboard</code>, so we use <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/2eb00a8050a69ab2e05ffeb11a2bbdcbadf9fb7e/Artsy/View_Controllers/Fair/ARProfileViewController.m#L55-L66">polymorphic view controllers</a>. This is a technique where the view controller returned then looks deeper into what it is representing and using child view controllers, embeds the true view controller inside itself.</p>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>Like all patterns, our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARSwitchboard</code> pattern is evolving. With Eigen we have  a complicated navigation stack, due to supporting app-wide tabs and hosting navigation controllers inside view controllers. This adds additional logic to pretty complicated code when we’re dealing with URLs that could be root elements of a tab. So we are planning to eventually move the presentation aspect of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARSwitchboard</code> into a separate object.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>
<p>We didn’t need an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARSwitchboard</code> in Eidolon. Which, so far always seems to be the exception in these architecture pattern posts. Instead we opted for Apple’s <a href="http://www.objc.io/issues/15-testing/dependency-injection/#which-di-framework-should-i-use">Dependency Injection tool</a>, Interface Builder + Storyboards. Energy pre-dates Storyboards, and they didn’t feel like a good fit for Eigen.</p>

<p>We found storyboards to be a really good replacement to this pattern when you have an established series of steps in your application with some well defined connections.</p>

<p>As an example, our on-boarding process for Eigen probably should have been storyboarded, as it’s a series of view controllers pushed incrementally. However given that the rest of Eigen is essentially a web of interconnected view controllers, we’d be abusing the tool.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>
<p>So the Switchboard is a way that we’ve managed to contain some of the complexity around having web-like abilities to jump between any two view controllers. This pattern makes it easy to stub a switchboard in tests, and to easily test the routing itself.</p>

<p>When I looked through some of the other open source iOS apps to compare the pattern, I couldn’t find anything similar. So if you do have something similar, you should probably Open Source your app ;)</p>

    <id>https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/15/Cocoa-Architecture-Router-Pattern</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to talk about a pattern that we’ve been using for the last few years on the Artsy Mobile team. This pattern pre-dates me joining Artsy by a few weeks, and was introduced into our codebase by <a href="http://90wpm.com">Ben Jackson</a>, this was the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRouter</code>’s first method:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Yep, that’s pre-ARC, pre-Dictionary Literals, memory-managed code. We took this pattern and rolled with it for the next 4 years, this article is about where we’ve taken it.</p>

<p>Within Eigen, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRouter</code> is one of our <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/904e8abfc11ce6ea4b6e81f0e02684b755a280c3/Artsy/Networking/ARRouter.m">biggest classes</a>, coming in at almost 1,000 lines of code. Whereas in Energy, it sits at a <a href="https://github.com/artsy/energy/blob/e51529250ede359c781042f222d5836eb9e8a979/Classes/Util/App/ARRouter.m">more reasonable</a> 300 lines. Eidolon does not have an ARRouter, what gives?</p>

<h2 id="pattern-evolution">Pattern Evolution</h2>

<p>We started out with a Router object as being something that can take a model object, and return a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSURL</code> corresponding to a server side end-point.</p>

<p>This worked pretty well, we shipped a 1.0 of Energy with this pattern. However, it become obvious that we were putting a lot of extra knowledge about the type and the parameters of request into classes whose responsibility was not generating a route. For example, user account creation, and user account deletion would use the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSURL</code> but have different HTTP methods.</p>

<p>We migrated our networking stack to using AFNetworking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.0</code>, and started using CocoaPods instead of manually dragging and dropping code. With this in mind, we improved on the pattern and started returning <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSURLRequest</code>s which better encapsulate the server end-point request we were trying to map in the Router.</p>

<p>The pattern evolved when mixed with a <a href="http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/AFNetworking/1.3.4/Classes/AFHTTPClient.html">AFHTTPClient</a> to act as the base URL resolver, allowing us to easily switch between staging and production environments, and as a central point for hosting all HTTP headers. This meant it was trivial to generate authenticated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSURLRequest</code>s.</p>

<p>As it is presently, this pattern is working. We’ve just wrapped up a new Pod, <a href="https://github.com/artsy/Artsy_Authentication">Artsy Authentication</a>. It’s a library that has an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRouter</code> that behaves <a href="https://github.com/artsy/Artsy_Authentication/blob/master/Pod/Classes/ArtsyAuthenticationRouter.h">exactly like above</a>. We continue to build new apps with the pattern.</p>

<h2 id="siblings">Siblings</h2>

<p>This pattern is standing the test of time, but that doesn’t mean we’re not actively trying to experiment within the domain. There are three interesting offshoots from our work on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRouter</code> that are worth talking about.</p>

<h4 id="got-the-routes-like-swagger">Got the Routes like Swagger</h4>

<p>The difference between Eigen’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRouter</code> and Energy’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRouter</code> is pretty simple. Eigen’s networking scope is an order of magnitude larger. This is a reflection on the varied data that Eigen is interested in, while Energy has a tight scope on specifically Artsy Parter related data.</p>

<p>During the new year of 2015, I explored the <a href="https://github.com/orta/GotTheRoutesLikeSwagger">idea of programmatically generating</a> an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRouter</code> as a CocoaPod, and then using CocoaPods’ subspecs to make it easy to define what collections of end-points you were interested in. This project is based on a standard in which an API is documented, <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>. This meant as an API consumer, I can generate the types of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSURLRequest</code>s I would require from the API itself. It created files that looked like:</p>

<div class="language-objc highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Generated by Routes Like Swagger - 31/12/14</span>

<span class="k">@interface</span> <span class="nc">ARRouter</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nl">User</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">/// Retrieve a user by id.</span>
<span class="c1">/// @return URLRequest for /api/v1/user/{id}.{format}</span>

<span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NSURLRequest</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">getUserWithID</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">NSString</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">slug</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">/// Update an existing user.</span>
<span class="c1">/// @return URLRequest for /api/v1/user/{id}.{format}</span>

<span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NSURLRequest</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">updateUserWithID</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">NSString</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">slug</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">...</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nf">snip</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">...</span>

<span class="k">@end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This was a pretty nice expansion of the pattern, but overall felt a bit over-engineered and so, it was left as just an experiment.</p>

<h4 id="moya">Moya</h4>

<p>When we started an entirely fresh application, we noted down all the networking-related pain points felt from Eigen and Energy. The Router pattern was pretty good, but we were finding that we were having problems with the API consuming part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSURLRequest</code>s. Mainly, a difficulty in testing, an inconsistency in how we would perform networking and that it didn’t feel declarative.</p>

<p>Moya is our attempt at fixing this. I won’t go into depth on what Moya is, we’ve <a href="/blog/2014/09/22/transparent-prerequisite-network-requests/">written articles</a> on this already. The part that is interesting is that it obviates an ARRouter by using a collection of Swift enums - forcing developers to include all necessary metadata an an end-point.</p>

<h4 id="hal-and-api-v2">HAL, and API v2</h4>

<p>The Router pattern relies on the idea that you know all the routes ahead of time, and add support for them as you build out each part of the app. <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL, a Hypermedia Application Layer</a> - can be approximated as being a self describing API. dB. wrote about it in <a href="/blog/2014/09/12/designing-the-public-artsy-api/">this blog post</a>.</p>

<p>This means that you ask the API how to get certain bits of data, and it will describe the ways in which you can access it.</p>

<p>Artsy’s future APIs are using this, and the Router pattern is, more or less, totally deprecated in this world. This is what an artwork’s JSON data looks like in v2:</p>

<p>You can see that via the _links section, curies and self-referential urls, you can build network client which traverses the API without built-in implicit knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s a really exciting pattern, and as client developers, we can work on improving standard API clients that work on all HAL APIs. Instead of something specific to Artsy’s API. A lot of the most interesting work in the Cocoa space has been done by Kyle Fuller with <a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/Hyperdrive">Hyperdrive</a>.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h3>

<p>Given that we’re not writing applications against the v2 API, yet. The Router pattern is working fine for us at Artsy. It can be a really nice way to abstract out a responsibility that may currently be sitting inside a very large API client that might be worth extracting out.</p>
