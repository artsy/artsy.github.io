    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have seen the future, and it looks a lot like GraphQL. Mark my words: in 5
years, newly minted full-stack app developers won’t be debating <em>RESTfulness</em>
anymore, because REST API design will be obsolete. By the end of this post, I
hope you'll see what I see in the promise of GraphQL as a new approach to
client-server interaction.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>GraphQL is taking the full-stack world by storm. In case you’re not familiar,
GraphQL is a language-independent specification for client-server communication.
It lets you model the resources and processes provided by a server as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain-specific language (DSL)</a>.
Clients can use it to send scripts written in your DSL to the server to process
and respond to as a batch.</p>

<p>That’s...different from how GraphQL’s own page describes it. GraphQL is better
known as a query language designed for clients to fetch exactly the data they
need. While this is sort of true, I would argue that GraphQL actually fails this
test in reality. It’s neither a query language, nor particularly graph-oriented.
I argue that it's <em>not</em> a query language because it comes with no native
concepts of operators and expressions that build up to queries. <em>You</em> build
whatever facilities for specifying and fulfilling queries on your own. Likewise,
if your data is a graph, it’s on you to expose that structure. But your requests
are, if anything, trees.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to be pedantic. I believe GraphQL succeeds at something subtler
and more important than literally being a graph query language. I’m writing this
piece because I kept running into difficulties approaching GraphQL from the
standpoints of REST, graph theory, or typical query languages. As I read blog
posts, StackOverflow Q&amp;As, issues on the GraphQL repo and the GraphQL spec
itself, I developed a much more nuanced understanding, which I outline below.</p>

<p>For brevity, the following assumes a intermediate familiarity with GraphQL,
including its type system, syntax, and server-side implementation. If you don’t
have this level of familiarity, I recommend going through any tutorial that
requires you to set up a GraphQL server, not just play with the query language
(which is how I ended up with a lot of misconceptions).
<a href="https://graphql.org/graphql-js/">The docs for the official JavaScript server library</a>
are a good option. I’m going to start with the basics, but only so I can put my
own spin on those concepts, not to really illustrate them with examples.</p>

<a name="A.tree.of.fetches"></a>
<h1>A tree of fetches</h1>

<p>Most applications are designed in the form of discrete pages, which are seeded
with some tiny chunk of data—say, a key or slug for some domain object—and then
perform a cascade of contingent fetches to get the data needed to populate the
templates rendered to a user. This is the basis of designing applications driven
by URL-based routing and it has been a mainstay of the MVC approach to web
application architecture for the past decade.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong> At Artsy, the seed of data for rendering an artwork page could be
the slug identifying some artwork. From this slug, we need a whole bunch more
data: the metadata of the artwork, information about the artist(s), sales data
if it’s available for purchase, information about the Artsy partner that owns
it, and so on. In classic REST, this data is aggregated by a cascade of dozens
of HTTP fetches to our backend API.</p></blockquote>

<p>I wasn’t in the room when GraphQL was invented, but it seems to me that the team
that built it made a particularly crucial insight:</p>

<blockquote><p>In most cases, all of this contingent fetching forms a tree, which is more or
less <em>fixed</em> for a given page.</p></blockquote>

<p>Data from early responses contain the keys for subsequent requests, but the
linkages between these requests are usually straightforward. So if it were
possible to factor all this disparate fetching into one spot and encode it into
one big “fetching tree” data structure ahead of time, this tree could be sent to
the the server, and the server could fulfill all of the data requirements in one
shot. This cuts out a tremendous amount of wasteful chatter between client and
server. Even in today's broadband world, bandwidth and latency matter,
especially for mobile users.</p>

<a name="GraphQL.anatomy"></a>
<h1>GraphQL anatomy</h1>

<blockquote><p><strong>Editorial note</strong> I'm going to use the term "operation" pretty liberally
here, but I mean it in the conceptual sense, not in the sense of the GraphQL
spec, where it defines the semantics of an entire GraphQL request.</p></blockquote>

<p>A GraphQL request always starts with at least <em>one root API operation</em> and some
finite number of follow-ups. Idiomatically, these follow-ups are queries,
meaning that they just retrieve data, without changing the server state in
observable ways. GraphQL models API operations as <strong>fields</strong>. How a field works
in GraphQL depends on its <strong>type</strong>, which falls into one of two basic
categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scalar</strong> types (<code>Int</code>, <code>Float</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Boolean</code>, and <code>ID</code>, as well as
application-defined <code>enum</code> and <code>scalar</code> types) represent the individual pieces
of <em>data actually sent to the client</em>. Contrary how I think of the term scalar
in other contexts, the data can be arbitrarily complex. As far as the GraphQL
spec is concerned, scalars are just opaque blobs of data with validation and
serialization rules. As an operation, a scalar field is terminal data fetch,
with no follow-ups. They are the leaves of the request tree.</li>
<li><strong>Object</strong> types (<code>type</code>, <code>union</code> and <code>interface</code>) are collections of fields.
As an operation, an object-typed field is an intermediate operation that
serves as the junction point for follow-up operations. But, it doesn’t
directly return any data. They are the branches of the request tree.</li>
</ul>


<p>The entire model for a given API is known as its <strong>schema</strong>. Every schema has a
root query type, whose fields serve as the API’s entry points.</p>

<pre><code># The root query object type
type Query {
  artwork(id: ID): Artwork
  artist(name: String)
  # … a whole bunch more root fields
}

type Artwork {
  title: String
  artist: Artist
}

type Artist {
  name: String
}
</code></pre>

<p>A GraphQL query request begins by mentioning at least one of the fields of the
root query object. This represents an initial query. And if that field is an
object, <em>its</em> fields are used to specify any number of follow-up queries.
Critically, <em>any</em> field in the request tree can take arguments, allowing a
request to be parameterized at all depths.</p>

<p>Take this query, for example:</p>

<pre><code>{
  artwork(id: "andy-warhol-campbells-soup-i-black-bean") {
    title
    artist {
      name
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we tell the server to look up an <code>Artwork</code> by its slug, and tell us the
title. So far, this is just like REST. But we <em>also</em> tell it to find us the
<code>Artist</code> for us. Importantly, object fields <em>must</em> be followed up with further
queries, and scalar fields <em>cannot</em> be. With that in mind, it’s easy to see that
<code>artwork</code> and <code>artist</code> are object fields, while <code>title</code> and <code>name</code> are scalar
fields.</p>

<p>Also note that the fact that there’s also an <code>artist</code> root query field actually
has nothing to do with its presence under <code>Artwork</code>. There can be multiple paths
to reach the same GraphQL type. This is defined explicitly by the schema.</p>

<p>Usefully, the server’s response to a GraphQL request will directly mirror the
shape of the request itself. The result of the request above looks like:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "data": {
    "artwork": {
      "title": "Campbell's Soup I: Black Bean",
      "artist": {
        "name": "Andy Warhol"
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<a name="GraphQL.as.a..meta-.scripting.language"></a>
<h1>GraphQL as a (meta-)scripting language</h1>

<p>Let’s dig a little deeper into the scripting language interpretation of GraphQL,
because this is the crux of how I think people should think of GraphQL. If I
were to guess, I think Facebook…</p>

<ul>
<li>…knows this is true. After all, much of the spec is devoted to
<a href="http://facebook.github.io/graphql/October2016/#sec-Execution">the execution model of GraphQL</a>.</li>
<li>…might have backed into this design. It’s well known that they think of their
data as a graph, so I suspect GraphQL might have begun literally as a "graph
query language", analogous to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> for
relational databases.</li>
<li>…thinks that this too difficult to explain, and thus, settled on the query
language paradigm.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are a couple reasons GraphQL might not look like a scripting language to
you. It didn’t to me, at first! After all, you don't write your request as list
of statements. It doesn’t have a concept of variables, other than parameters to
the whole document. There are no looping constructs or recursion. But I think a
closer look might shift your perspective.</p>

<a name="Control.flow"></a>
<h2>Control flow</h2>

<p>It’s true that a GraphQL request doesn’t follow the same vertical sequence of
steps model familiar to most programming languages. But sequencing <em>does</em> exist.
It’s just represented by calling nested fields of object types, terminating in a
scalar field. See this request:</p>

<pre><code>{
  step1(arg: “something”) {
    step2 {
      step3(arg: "something else”) {
        outputScalar
      }
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>In a more traditional language, this would look more like:</p>

<pre><code>step1(“something”)
step2()
return step3(“something else”)
</code></pre>

<p>So, sequencing got a bit more verbose, but it <em>is</em> there.</p>

<p>Interestingly, GraphQL reserves vertical stacking for something that’s an
afterthought in most languages: <em>concurrency</em>. (Granted, there’s no way to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_(computer_science)">synchronize</a>
concurrent paths of execution.) I’m not going to quote
<a href="https://facebook.github.io/graphql/October2016/">the spec</a>, but search it
yourself, and you can find the word “parallel” in there several times. This
design is intentional.</p>

<a name="Variables"></a>
<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>One of the core aspects of programming is the ability to pass intermediate data
around. The most basic way languages accomplish this is with named variables.
Many languages allow variables to be reassigned; some don't. GraphQL doesn’t
have them at all! But that doesn’t mean data can’t be propagated.</p>

<p>GraphQL supports one kind of propagation, which is the propagation of context
down the sequence of resolvers. It happens implicitly and invisibly. Exactly
what data is propagated and what that means is up to you.</p>

<p>How does this work? Well, if you have worked on GraphQL server code, you know
that every field has a <strong>resolver</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>For scalar fields, the resolver is responsible for returning the actual data
that the client sees.</li>
<li>For object fields, the resolver instead returns a hidden chunk of data that is
forwarded along to the resolvers of the fields contained in the object. So
these resolvers get their parent object’s hidden data, the global context, and
any arguments, and they can use all of these values to produce their value.</li>
</ul>


<p>Often, we just resolve an object field to a domain object. Its scalar fields
might correspond to properties of that domain object and its object fields might
correspond to related objects. But the architecture is more powerful than this!
A deeply nested field can potentially be the result of the resolved values of
all its parents. It all depends on how you design your resolvers to work
together.</p>

<p>This pattern reminds me a bit of when <a href="https://api.jquery.com/">jQuery</a> first
clicked for me. A lot of details are propagated invisibly within your <code>jquery</code>
object as you chain method calls to refine your DOM selections.</p>

<a name="Looping.and.recursion"></a>
<h2>Looping and recursion</h2>

<p>GraphQL doesn’t have them, plain and simple. Consequently, the GraphQL DSLs you
design are not
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing-complete</a>--they will
always halt in a finite amount of steps. This is really important, because it
prevents clients from being able to send servers on errands that will never end.
Of course, the <em>implementations</em> of field resolvers on the server are free to do
whatever they want in full Turing-complete glory.</p>

<a name="Putting.it.together"></a>
<h2>Putting it together</h2>

<p>My point here is that the execution model of GraphQL is in many ways just like a
scripting language interpreter. The limitations of its model are strategic, to
keep the technology focused on client-server interaction. What's interesting is
that you as a developer provide nearly all of the definition of what operations
exist, what they mean, and how they compose. For this reason, I consider GraphQL
to be a <em>meta-scripting language</em>, or, in other words, a toolkit for building
scripting languages.</p>

<a name="The.post-REST.world"></a>
<h1>The post-REST world</h1>

<p>Subtly, this paradigm is a sharp step away from a whole body of knowledge that
models APIs as resources with fixed verbs, which we know as REST. It’s more
appropriate to think of GraphQL requests as a script of remote procedure calls
(RPC). From this perspective, the design of the schema is a lot less about data
modeling than it is a question of how you want your entire API to be traversed.
This encourages a verb-oriented mindset.</p>

<a name="Verb.orientation"></a>
<h2>Verb orientation</h2>

<p>Speaking of verbs, you can think of "fetch" as being the default verb in
GraphQL. You model other verbs as <strong>mutations</strong>. I delayed learning about
mutations, because I thought they must be way more complex than queries. Quite
the opposite! They all sit in one big, flat bucket at the root of your schema,
as the fields of the root <code>mutation</code> type. These fields have a type too, and if
it is an object type, then you can issue effectively any number of follow-up
queries after your mutation completes. Learning about mutations was when it
really dawned on me that <em>fields are just function calls</em>.</p>

<p>Mutations are a major break with REST. In GraphQL, your mutations are defined
under root mutation object that is separate from your root query object.
Therefore, you are immediately asked to accept that they don't represent verbs
on a resource, but verbs <em>on your entire service</em>. This eliminates one of REST’s
key weak points, namely that complex operations that touch multiple parts of an
application’s data model are difficult to model as a PUT, DELETE, POST, or PATCH
on a single resource. In my experience, this "impedance mismatch” between API
modeling and domain modeling has led to the worst aspects of my HTTP API
designs.</p>

<a name="REST.is.dead..Long.live.REST."></a>
<h2>REST is dead. Long live REST!</h2>

<p>It is borderline heresy in some circles to suggest that REST API design is dead.
But I’m saying it. Don’t get me wrong, REST is still a great paradigm for
serving static assets. It’s the <em>API</em> part I have an issue with.</p>

<p>Ironically, I think there’s a strong argument that a GraphQL request document
maps very nicely to the concept of a resource:</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn’t change that often, and you could PUT it to store it, perhaps using
a hash of the request document to form the URL.</li>
<li>GraphQL queries map elegantly to GET operations on a stored query request
document’s URL.</li>
<li>GraphQL mutations map decently to POST operations to a stored mutation request
document’s URL.</li>
<li>The arguments of a GraphQL request map elegantly to HTTP query parameters.</li>
</ul>


<p>In other words, GraphQL is simply another formalization layer of HTTP-based API
design. Think of it as being akin to the way JSON representation changed the way
we think about client-server communication in full-stack apps. It’s not so much
that REST will cease to exist, but that it will fade to the background, as an
implementation detail of GraphQL application frameworks.</p>

<a name="GraphQL.is.not.your.data.model"></a>
<h1>GraphQL is not your data model</h1>

<p>Another realization I’ve had in learning to apply GraphQL is that the schema is
<em>not</em> the actual data model, and therefore raw GraphQL responses cannot be
directly used by the client. You <em>could</em> choose to think of it this way, but
you’re likely to run into some conundrums:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/graphql/issues/101">There is no free-form map data structure</a>.
There are only objects with fixed fields, scalars, and lists.</li>
<li>It is difficult to design abstractions over types.</li>
<li>The object tree you get in return from a query request is neither normalized
nor is it an object graph (multiple copies of the same object may be
returned).</li>
<li>Commonly used protocol patterns, like
<a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/graphql-connections.html">the connection pattern</a>,
require explicit modeling within your schema.</li>
<li>The limitations of GraphQL's type system make certain modeling techniques
difficult to directly model, such as
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47933512/representing-enum-object-variant-type-in-graphql">singletons within unions</a>.</li>
<li>Recursive data types can’t be queried to undefined depth in their nested form.
Think of your comment board with nested replies.</li>
</ul>


<p>The upshot of this is that there likely needs to be some process of conversion
from your native data model on your server to your GraphQL API, and then again
from your client’s API consumption code to its internal data model.
<a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a> and
<a href="https://www.apollographql.com/client">Apollo</a> serve this purpose. Their utility
wasn’t immediately clear to me when I naively imagined GraphQL to literally be a
system for reproducing a slice of server-side object graph. (Hmm, where might I
have gotten that impression from?)</p>

<p>A lot of discussion in the GraphQL space centers on data modeling—the nouns.
There’s a lot of debate and worthwhile work to be done on that front, but one of
my primary reasons for writing this piece is to think about the verbs. What
happens when you think of GraphQL requests as not just verbs, but <em>chains</em> of
verbs? My inkling is that you start to be able to represent services in a much
more fluid way. Complex processes no longer have to be orchestrated by API
clients or hidden behind unwieldy black-box POST endpoints. Instead, clients can
compose processes from the easily inspectable building blocks that the server
provides via its GraphQL schema. That’s a whole different approach to API
design.</p>

<a name="So..where.to.now."></a>
<h1>So, where to now?</h1>

<p>I began by asserting that the future looks a lot <em>like</em> GraphQL. But I did not
say that GraphQL <em>is the future</em>. I hedge because there are a lot of unanswered
questions and some pain points within today’s GraphQL, even as it paints a
compelling picture of the future. I may write a follow-up piece bringing up some
of these gripes. At the moment, Facebook still largely controls the development
of the technology and it has been slow to evolve. Arguably, this is a good
thing, as the full-stack community continues to digest the basic concepts. But
I’m sure impatient folks will attempt forks or create parallel technologies. How
it all balances out is anybody’s guess.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, today’s GraphQL is already a tremendous leap forward from REST API
design. It much more directly models the sort of data traversals a client needs
to perform in order to do its job. I expect significant refinement within this
space over the next couple years. And after a couple more, the days before
GraphQL will be just another source of lore for grizzled vets like us.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our mission at Artsy has been to make a world where everyone is moved by art every day, and at a high level, the way that our engineering team supports that mission is through building software. We have built systems and databases and user interfaces that represent different facets of the art world, and throughout our work, we have... made some mistakes.</p>

<p>That's okay! Programmers make mistakes all the time. There is <a href="https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood">a large list of blog posts</a> describing various programmer misconceptions, from subjects you might expect would be simple to model in computers, like units of measurement and time, to subjects that are based more in the human condition, like postal addresses and marriage.</p>

<p>In the interest of openness and sharing what we've learned, the Artsy Engineering team has come up with the following list of misconceptions programmers believe about art. Thank you to everyone at Artsy who contributed to this list.</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>All artworks have an artist (some artworks are attributed to "cultural makers", others have a manufacturer).</li>
<li>All artworks have exactly one artist (some artworks are collaborations).</li>
<li>All artworks are unique (there are editions, reproductions, and series of works, and modeling the relationships between them all is nontrivial).</li>
<li>All lots in an art auction are artworks (some lots are "experiential", like a visit to an artist's studio).</li>
<li>Only rich people buy art.</li>
<li>Only rich people can afford to buy art, and everyone else just buys posters of "real" art.</li>
<li>All artworks have a title (some are untitled).</li>
<li>"Untitled" signifies an artwork has no title (some artworks are titled "Untitled").</li>
<li>All artwork titles can fit inside 512 characters (not true, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artwork/matt-goerzen-sockpuppet-theatre-representing-the-techniques-tools-and-environments-whereby-hackers-and-other-info-warriors-might-seek-to-parse-through-elsewhere-distorted-informational-domains-to-make-sense-of-them-and-also-possibly-to-acquire-by-illicit-or-clever-means-good-information-that-can-then-be-communicated-in-a-way-that-sheds-light-on-deceptions-but-can-also-be-difficult-to-evaluate-on-their-own-terms-due-to-the-elite-requisites-of-interpreting-such-knowledge-or-more-generalized-uncertaintities-regarding">here is a counterexample</a>).</li>
<li>An artwork is associated with a natural, canonical category.</li>
<li>An artwork belongs to only one gallery/collector/auction house at a time (provenance of artworks is complicated, and there is no canonical source of truth).</li>
<li>Art should always be rendered at its maximum size (there are complex business constraints and art world norms that need to be considered).</li>
<li>People buy art mostly for its visual qualities (most people buy art because of a story, because they understand what the artwork is trying to say, or because they simply can't stop thinking about it).</li>
<li>People don't buy art from JPEGs (in fact, people buy art that hasn't even been created yet).</li>
<li>"My kid can paint that" (<a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/707273704640798720">but did they?</a>).</li>
<li>The art market needs technology because it's inefficient (the art market needs technology because technology can help expand the entire art world).</li>
<li>Intermediaries in the art market are bad (eg. galleries: they enable artists to make works for years before they sell anything, they are the enabler, not the obstacle).</li>
<li>There is one "art world" (there are thousands of galleries around the world, specializing in everything from contemporary jewelry and emerging conceptual art to Chinese scroll painting and regional landscapes).</li>
<li>Your opinion on art doesn't matter, the industry will independently determine value of an artwork (everyone has opinions, your appreciation of art is <em>all</em> about <em>you</em>).</li>
<li>The art world is hermetic and isn't relevant to my life (in fact the arts contribute billions of dollars to the economy, employ thousands of people, have a ripple effect on urban life, and are often a major source of inspiration for the TV, movies, and books we all consume on a daily basis).</li>
<li>Gallerists are fancy people in a luxury business, living fancy lives (in fact, the average salary for a gallery owner is way lower than you think).</li>
<li>Art and engineering are orthogonal (nope, just look at us!).</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Artsy Engineering we encourage a culture of experimentation with something called <em>labs</em>.</p>

<p>A new feature released into production is usually only turned on for a handful of users. We get feedback from our own team and a tiny group of early adopters, iterate, fix bugs, toss failed experiments and work on promoting complete, well behaved features to all users. The labs infrastructure gives us a chance to sleep on an idea and polish details. It also allows us to make progress continuously and flip a switch on the very last day.</p>

<p>My favorite labs features push our collective imagination and give birth to productive brainstorms around coffee at a popular startup hangout around the corner from our Manhattan office. But the team's favorite labs are, by far, those that ship as easter eggs. These are fun and sometimes useful features that don't make much business sense. So, before I explain our rudimentary labs system, I want to invite you to our easter egg hunt. Check out <a href="https://artsy.net/humans.txt">https://artsy.net/humans.txt</a> for instructions.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Our labs infrastructure is rather straightforward. A lab feature data model is pretty boring, with the exception of a <code>created_by</code> field. Each such lab feature belongs to an engineer and you have to nurture your feature and fight for it to meet the production bar!</p>

<pre><code class="ruby app/models/lab_feature.rb">class LabFeature
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Timestamps

  field :name
  field :created_by
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can enable and disable a lab feature for a given user.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby app/models/user.rb">class User
  references_and_referenced_in_many :lab_features

  def enable_lab_feature!(feature)
    lab_features.push(feature) unless lab_features.member?(feature)
    save!
  end

  def disable_lab_feature!(feature)
    lab_features.delete(feature)
    save!
  end

  def lab_feature_enabled?(feature)
    lab_features.member?(feature)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>In Ruby, we check whether the user has a lab with <code>lab_feature_enabled?</code>. In JavaScript, we return the lab features in a Backbone.js collection and check for the same.</p>

<pre><code class="coffeescript app/coffeescripts/models/user.coffee">class App.Models.CurrentUser extends Backbone.Model

  hasLabFeature: (feature_name) -&gt;
    $.inArray(feature_name, @get('lab_features')) &gt;= 0
</code></pre>

<p>We also have a bit of UI and an API to let you turn a lab feature on and off when you're part of our labs program. The program itself is also a lab feature!</p>

<p>Lab features can be retired after the code is promoted to all users or deleted.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby app/models/lab_feature.rb">class LabFeature
  def retire!
    User.all.each do |u|
      u.disable_lab_feature!(self)
    end
    destroy
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This "system" is super simple. I encourage you to think more in terms of experiments or labs - it helped us foster a culture of innovation, tremendously reduced risk of catastrophic failures, and, because anyone can push anything into labs at any time, removed the unnecessary discussions around whether an idea is worthy of an implementation at all.</p>
