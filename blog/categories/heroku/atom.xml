<p>Heroku users frequently run the <strong>heroku</strong> command-line tool that ships with the <a href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com/">Heroku Toolbelt</a>. It has two very convenient features: it will remember API credentials and default to the "heroku" GIT remote to figure out the application to connect to. Neither of these features are available in the Heroku client API, so it's not unusual to find developers invoke the Heroku CLI from Rake tasks and other automation scripts.</p>

<p>There're several problems with using the Heroku CLI for automation:</p>

<ol>
<li>The exit code from <code>heroku run</code> is not the exit code from the process being run on Heroku. See <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku/issues/186">#186</a>.</li>
<li>Gathering console output from <code>heroku run:detached</code> requires an external <code>heroku logs --tail</code> process that will never finish.</li>
</ol>


<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dblock/heroku-commander">heroku-commander</a> gem wraps execution of the Heroku CLI to overcome these common limitations.</p>

<h3>Heroku Configuration</h3>

<p>```ruby
commander = Heroku::Commander.new</p>

<h1>a hash of all settings for your default heroku app</h1>

<p>commander.config
```</p>

<p>Notice that unlike <code>Heroku::Client.new</code>, this doesn't require your e-mail or API key. It will invoke <code>heroku config -s</code>.</p>

<p>You can specify an application name, too.</p>

<p>```ruby
commander = Heroku::Commander.new({ :app => "heroku-commander" })</p>

<h1>a hash of all settings for the heroku-commander application</h1>

<p>commander.config
```</p>

<h3>Run Commands on Heroku</h3>

<p>```ruby
commander = Heroku::Commander.new</p>

<h1>returns all output lines</h1>

<h1>eg. [ "Linux 2.6.32-348-ec2 #54-Ubuntu SMP x86_64 GNU" ]</h1>

<p>commander.run "uname -a"
```</p>

<p>This calls <code>(heroku run 2&gt;&amp;1 uname -a; echo rc=\\$?)</code>, parses output for the final exit code line and raises an exception if the run's result code wasn't zero. In other words, if the command fails, an error is raised, which makes this suitable for Rake tasks.</p>

<p>You can also read output line-by-line.</p>

<p><code>ruby
commander.run "ls -1" do |line|
  # each line from the output of ls -1
end
</code></p>

<h3>Detach Commands on Heroku</h3>

<p><code>ruby
commander = Heroku::Commander.new
commander.run("ls -R", { :detached =&gt; true }) do |line|
  # each line from the output of ls -r -1
end
</code></p>

<p>This calls <code>(heroku detached:run ls -r -1 2&gt;&amp;1; echo rc=\\$?)</code>, parses the output for a Heroku process ID, spawns a <code>heroku logs --tail -p pid</code> and monitors the log output until it reports process completion. It will also parse output for the final exit code and raise an exception if the run's result code wasn't zero.</p>

<p>Seeing bundler hang on "Fetching gem metadata from http://rubygems.org/", my immediate reaction was to blame the RubyGems Dependency API for its poor performance and attempt the <a href="http://hone.herokuapp.com/bundler%20heroku/2012/10/22/rubygems-and-the-dependency-api.html">recommended workaround</a> of switching to <em>http://bundler-api.herokuapp.com</em>. That didn't work.</p>

<p>I also tried to reproduce the issue on a local environment, including a (what I thought was) a completely clean machine at no avail. My <code>bundle install</code> would always succeed.</p>

<p>Finally, everything pointed at an infrastructure problem with Heroku itself, so I opened a ticket (#72648), <a href="https://twitter.com/dblockdotorg/status/290221530892365824">tweeted</a> endlessly to Heroku devs, pinged a  contact at Heroku on Skype and generally annoyed people for 5 straight days. It was a frustrating problem and I was getting no useful help.</p>

<p>Fast forward, this turned out to be <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/issues/2248">an issue in Bundler</a>. Narrowing it down would have been relatively easy if I had known where to look.</p>

<p>I hope this post helps you with similar issues.</p>

<h2>Heroku Slug Compiler</h2>

<p>Heroku provides small Ubuntu virtual machines on-demand, called "dynos", that look very much like any other Linux box. You can <code>heroku run bash</code> and examine the file system of a running dyno. You can delete the bundler cache, rerun <code>bundle install</code>, etc. But deployment does not happen in a running dyno - every time you push to Heroku, deployment happens inside a compiler dyno. Heroku attaches the dyno to your slug filesystem (your code), which may include a cache from previous runs. It then executes the code inside <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby">heroku-buildpack-ruby</a>, specifically <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby/blob/5dbf4c06c765dc832c073fe5be9360533fd1846d/lib/language_pack/ruby.rb#L49">this method</a>.</p>

<p>``` ruby
def compile
  Dir.chdir(build_path)
  remove_vendor_bundle
  install_ruby
  install_jvm
  setup_language_pack_environment
  setup_profiled
  allow_git do</p>

<pre><code>install_language_pack_gems
build_bundler
create_database_yml
install_binaries
run_assets_precompile_rake_task
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>A lot of these functions invoke <code>IO.open</code> and transmit <code>$stdout</code> and <code>$stderr</code> back to you. You see everything Heroku sees and while you cannot get access to the compiler dyno, there's really no mystery to this process. Heroku slug compiler will timeout after 15 minutes and produce a stack with <code>Utils::TimeoutError</code>. And everything Heroku does should be reproducible locally.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting Bundler</h2>

<p>The key to getting a repro of my issue locally was to use the <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/blob/master/ISSUES.md">Bundler Troubleshooting</a> section. I had previously missed one of the steps in cleaning the local Bundler cache.</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>remove user-specific gems and git repos</h1>

<p>rm -rf ~/.bundle/ ~/.gem/bundler/ ~/.gems/cache/bundler/</p>

<h1>remove system-wide git repos and git checkouts</h1>

<p>rm -rf $GEM_HOME/bundler/ $GEM_HOME/cache/bundler/</p>

<h1>remove project-specific settings and git repos</h1>

<p>rm -rf .bundle/</p>

<h1>remove project-specific cached .gem files</h1>

<p>rm -rf vendor/cache/</p>

<h1>remove the saved resolve of the Gemfile</h1>

<p>rm -rf Gemfile.lock</p>

<h1>uninstall the rubygems-bundler and open_gem gems</h1>

<p>rvm gemset use global # if using rvm
gem uninstall rubygems-bundler open_gem</p>

<h1>try to install one more time</h1>

<p>bundle install
```</p>

<p>This hung with my Gemfile the same way as on Heroku.</p>

<h2>Bundler Dependency Resolver</h2>

<p>So what is bundler doing?</p>

<p>Bundler runs the gem dependency resolver, which is described in detail in <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2011/9/24/how-does-bundler-bundle">Pat Shaughnessy's blog post</a>. The post suggests running <code>DEBUG_RESOLVER=1 bundle install</code>, which produced a mountain of output that isn't very helpful.</p>

<p>I made a <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/pull/2249">pull request</a> with a similar setting called <code>DEBUG_RESOLVER_TREE</code>, which reduces the output to the gems being resolved. This helped me narrow down a <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/issues/2248">small repro</a>. I was also able to make some sense of what bundler was doing: backtracking in an attempt to find a combination of gems matching the versions declared in <code>Gemfile</code> for every combinations of <code>railties</code>, <code>actionmailer</code>, <code>activeresource</code>, <code>activerecord</code>, <code>actionpack</code> and <code>builder</code> above version 3.2, only to fail to find a compatible version of <code>builder</code> every single time. That's a lot of versions to try.</p>

<p>Adding an entry for <code>builder</code> to <code>Gemfile</code> fixed the issue.</p>

<p>Similar issues to my <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/issues/2248">#2248</a> in Bundler have been reported in <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/issues/2030">#2030</a>, <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/issues/2090">#2090</a> and <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/issues/2125">#2125</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.com/blog/2012/12/13/beat-heroku-60-seconds-application-boot-timeout-with-a-proxy/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-13T21:21:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.com/blog/2012/12/13/beat-heroku-60-seconds-application-boot-timeout-with-a-proxy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://artsy.github.com/images/2012-12-13-beat-heroku-60-seconds-application-boot-timeout-with-a-proxy/heroku-logo-light-234x60.png"></p>

<p>Heroku will log an <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/error-codes#r10-boot-timeout">R10 - Boot Timeout</a> error when a web process takes longer than 60 seconds to bind to its assigned port. This error is often caused by a process being unable to reach an external resource, such as a database or because you have a lot of gems in your <code>Gemfile</code> which take a long time to load.</p>

<p><code>
Dec 12 12:12:12 prod heroku/web.1:
  Error R10 (Boot timeout)
  Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 60 seconds of launch
</code></p>

<p>There's currently no way to increase this boot timeout, but we can beat it with a proxy implemented by our new <a href="https://github.com/dblock/heroku-forward">heroku-forward</a> gem.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The concepts for <code>heroku-forward</code> come from <a href="http://noverloop.be/beating-herokus-60s-boot-times-with-the-cedar-stack-and-a-reverse-proxy/">this article</a> by Nicolas Overloop. The basic idea is to have a proxy bind to the port immediately and then buffer requests until the backend came up. The proxy implementation is Ilya Grigorik's <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/em-proxy">em-proxy</a>. Communication between the proxy and the backend happens over a unix domain socket (a file), which needed a bit of work (see <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/em-proxy/pull/31">#31</a>), inspired by an excellent article, <a href="http://jgwmaxwell.com/fighting-the-unicorns-becoming-a-thin-wizard-on-heroku">Fighting the Unicorns: Becoming a Thin Wizard on Heroku</a> by JGW Maxwell. The <code>heroku-forward</code> gem connects all the dots.</p>

<p>Check out the gem's <a href="https://github.com/dblock/heroku-forward/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for how to set it up.</p>

<p>Here's the log output from an application that uses this gem. Notice that Heroku reports the state of <code>web.1</code> up after just 4 seconds, while the application takes 67 seconds to boot.</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.com/blog/2012/11/29/measuring-performance-in-grape-apis-with-new-relic/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-29T21:21:00-05:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Knowing how well your API performs in real time is essential to any successful project. That's because you can't fix what you can't measure.</p>

<p>We use and heavily contribute to <a href="http://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a>, a Ruby API DSL. Grape is a Rack middleware and we have been reporting API performance data to <a href="http://newrelic.com/">NewRelic</a> with code from <a href="http://code.dblock.org/new-relic-performance-instrumentation-with-grape-api">my older blog post</a>.</p>

<p>It's time to improve the reporting implementation and address performance monitoring in both development and production environments. Here's what a single API request breakdown is going to look like.</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.com/images/2012-11-29-measuring-performance-in-grape-apis-with-new-relic/transaction-detail.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>NewRelic RPM</h2>

<p>The first step is to add the <code>newrelic_rpm</code> gem to Gemfile, which implements the actual realtime performance reporting to NewRelic. We also use <a href="https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid">Mongoid</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mongoid/moped">Moped</a> MongoDB Ruby driver, which can be instrumented with <code>newrelic_moped</code>.</p>

<p><code>ruby Gemfile
gem "newrelic_moped", "0.0.3"
gem "newrelic_rpm", "3.3.3"
</code></p>

<p>You will need <code>config/newrelic.yml</code> in your application. Ours can be found in <a href="https://gist.github.com/4170458">this gist</a> and works well both locally and on Heroku.</p>

<h2>Instrumenting Grape</h2>

<p>In the past we used <a href="https://gist.github.com/1233422">NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::API</a>, which works for any generic Rack middleware. This would report all API calls to NewRelic, but would treat requests to <em>/api/artist/andy-warhol</em> and <em>/api/artist/wassily-kandinsky</em> as unrelated. That is because the instrumenter is a Rack middleware that wraps Grape requests <em>before</em> they reach Grape. The only information available is the request URL, and not the actual API route that is going to be matched when the request is processed.</p>

<p>We want both requests to <em>/api/artist/andy-warhol</em> and <em>/api/artist/wassily-kandinsky</em> to be treated as <em>/api/artist/:id</em>. Lets insert a middleware inside Grape itself, once the URL has been matched to a route.</p>

<p><code>ruby api.rb
class API &lt;&lt; Grape::API
  use ApiNewRelicInstrumenter
  ...
end
</code></p>

<p>The new instrumenter has access to the current API endpoint via <code>env['api.endpoint']</code> and reports data via NewRelic's <code>ControllerInstrumentation</code>.</p>

<p>``` ruby
class ApiNewRelicInstrumenter &lt; Grape::Middleware::Base
  include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation</p>

<p>  def call(env)</p>

<pre><code>trace_options = {
  category: :rack,
  path: env['api.endpoint'].routes.first.route_path,
  request: request,
  ...
}

perform_action_with_newrelic_trace(trace_options) do
  yield
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The complete code for <code>ApiNewRelicInstrumenter</code> can be found in <a href="https://gist.github.com/4170469">this gist</a>. It supports enabling and disabling performance reporting by setting <code>NEW_RELIC_ID</code> and works around NewRelic's method name limitations (these cannot contain slashes).</p>

<h2>Development Environment</h2>

<p>You can now see NewRelic performance data in development mode, too. If you mount Grape inside Rails run <code>NEW_RELIC_ID=foo rails s</code>. Navigate to <em>http://localhost:3000/newrelic</em> to see your local traces.</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.com/images/2012-11-29-measuring-performance-in-grape-apis-with-new-relic/developer-mode.png"></p>

<p>Drill into an individual request to find several detailed breakdowns of how time was spent, including specific MongoDB queries (under "SQL", naturally).</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.com/images/2012-11-29-measuring-performance-in-grape-apis-with-new-relic/sql-detail.png"></p>

<p>NewRelic is a commercial product, but you can run development mode for free! Note that enabling this will triple your local Rails boot time: we enable development mode by setting <code>development_mode: &lt;%= !!ENV['NEW_RELIC_ID'] %&gt;</code> in <a href="https://gist.github.com/4170458">newrelic.rpm</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.com/blog/2012/11/15/how-to-monitor-503s-and-timeout-on-heroku/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-15T21:21:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.com/blog/2012/11/15/how-to-monitor-503s-and-timeout-on-heroku</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have recently started hitting an unusually high number of "503: Service Unavailable" errors with one of our applications on Heroku. What are these? How can we monitor their quantity and frequency? What's the fix?</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.com/images/2012-11-15-how-to-monitor-503s-and-timeout-on-heroku/503-error.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What does 503 mean?</h2>

<p>A 503 error means "Service Unavailable". Heroku returns a 503 error when an HTTP request times out between the Heroku routing mesh and your application, including when the application failed to boot. This timeout limit is set to 30 seconds, as <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/request-timeout">documented by Heroku</a>, and shows up in the logs as follows.</p>

<p><code>
Nov 14 12:10:50 production heroku/router:
 Error H12 (Request timeout) -&gt; GET artsy.net/api/spline
 dyno=web.11 queue= wait= service=30000ms status=503 bytes=0
</code></p>

<p>This usually means that the application could not process the request fast enough, and in very rare cases, that there's an infrastructure problem with Heroku itself. A 504 error which means "Gateway Timeout" would have probably been a more appropriate choice. Either way, the root cause could be something as simple as trying to run a very long database query or do too much work that doesn't fit in a 30 seconds window. It could also involve an external service that didn't respond quickly enough. Your mileage may vary.</p>

<h2>Monitoring 503s</h2>

<p>503 errors don't happen within your application, they are reported by the routing mesh. They will not appear in internal monitoring systems attached to your app, including <a href="http://newrelic.com/">NewRelic</a>.</p>

<p>We get the frequency of 503s by sending our Heroku logs to <a href="https://papertrailapp.com/">Papertrail</a> and using their <a href="http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/how-it-works/alerts">alerts feature</a> to push the number of 503s to <a href="http://www.geckoboard.com/">Geckoboard</a>. You can send these to <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a> or any other monitoring system in the same manner.</p>

<p>This is what it looks like:</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.com/images/2012-11-15-how-to-monitor-503s-and-timeout-on-heroku/503-geckoboard.png"></p>

<h2>Aborting Requests</h2>

<p>When Heroku reports a 503 status code, it just gives up. Your application continues executing the request though, often to completion, which may take forever. In the meantime, Heroku will send a new request to the dyno that's still busy, and get a new 503. This is known as a "stuck" dyno.</p>

<p>To prevent dynos from being stuck you must abort the request within the 30 second period. This can be accomplished with the <a href="https://github.com/kch/rack-timeout">rack-timeout</a> gem and setting <code>Rack::Timeout.timeout = 29</code> in an initializer (or a smaller value within which you want to guarantee a response). The gem automatically inserts itself into a Rails application, but you will need to manually mount it in other Rack apps, such as those using <a href="https://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a>.</p>

<p>``` ruby api.rb
class Api &lt; Grape::API
  use Rack::Timeout</p>

<p>  desc "Returns a reticulated spline."
  get "spline/:id"</p>

<pre><code>Spline.find(params[:id])
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Because your application is now getting a timeout exception, you can also report it in NewRelic. The following works in Grape.</p>

<p>``` ruby
rescue_from Timeout::Error, :backtrace => true do |e|
  NewRelic::Agent.instance.error_collector.notice_error e,</p>

<pre><code>uri: request.path,
referer: request.referer,
request_params: request.params
</code></pre>

<p>  rack_response({</p>

<pre><code>:type =&gt; "timeout_error",
:message =&gt; "The request timed out."
</code></pre>

<p>  }.to_json, 503)
end
```</p>

<p>Don't forget to write a test!</p>

<p>``` ruby api_spec.rb
require 'spec_helper'</p>

<p>describe Api do
  it "times out after Rack::Timeout.timeout" do</p>

<pre><code>Rack::Timeout.stub(:timeout).and_return(1)
Spline.stub(:find) { sleep 3 }
get "/spline/1"
response.status.should == 503
response.body.should == '{"type":"timeout_error","message":"The request timed out."}'
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h2>Fixing Timeouts</h2>

<p>The root causes of timeouts are specific to your application. Our general approach for long running requests is to offload the request processing into a delayed job or background process and "cook" data in a way that makes it readily available to API endpoints. You can read more about this and related aspects of our system architecture in <a href="/blog/2012/10/10/artsy-technology-stack/">this earlier blog post</a>.</p>
