    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I joined Artsy, <a href="http://code.dblock.org">dB</a> pitched me this idea: <em>Open source as default.</em></p>

<p>I took this to heart. I genuinely believe the idea behind the philosophy. It's cool that our real product isn't our implementations on the web or native but the data which powers it - <a href="https://artsy.net/theartgenomeproject">the Art Genome Project</a>. Similarly, I spend a bunch of time <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/ARCollectionViewMasonryLayout">on</a> <a href="https://github.com/dblock/ARASCIISwizzle">open</a> <a href="https://github.com/dblock/ios-snapshot-test-case-expecta">sourcing</a> <a href="https://github.com/dblock/ARTiledImageView">solid</a> <a href="https://github.com/dstnbrkr/DRBOperationTree">abstractions</a> <a href="https://github.com/orta/ORSimulatorKeyboardAccessor">from</a> <a href="https://github.com/orta/ORStackView">our</a> <a href="https://github.com/orta/ARAnalytics">apps</a>, always taking the opinion if something is used in more than one place, it should be open sourced.</p>

<p>This week I pushed some libraries that were a bit different, read on to find out why.</p>

<a name="The.problem"></a>
<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>I was modernizing a section of <a href="http://orta.github.io/#folio-header-unit">Folio</a> that hasn't changed in 2 years to use custom UILabel subclasses consistent with <a href="https://iphone.artsy.net">the Artsy iOS app</a> and realized I was copying and pasting a large amount of code from one app to the other. This got me thinking about ways to keep this code in one place, as we might start another project which needs these same styles soon.</p>

<a name="The.solution"></a>
<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>I didn't want to put it on the public CocoaPods Spec Repo, because it's not very relevant to the larger community, but in keeping with our philosophy of "open source by default," I definitely wanted to publish it as an example for others. The most elegant answer was to create our own <a href="https://github.com/artsy/specs">public Specs Repo</a>, which serves as a good reference when people want to know what a private specs repo looks like.</p>

<p>Like anyone who has tried to modularize a pretty large code-base, it turns out a lot of things were connected together. I couldn't just build my <a href="http://github.com/Artsy/Artsy-UILabels">Artsy+UILabels</a> repo and put everything in there. Instead I had to also build Artsy+UIFonts and <a href="http://github.com/Artsy/Artsy-UIColors">Artsy+UIColors</a>.</p>

<p>One of the good things about having to build three libraries is that I became very familiar with <code>pod lib create</code>. This is a command for building the scaffolding around a CocoaPod, making it much easier to create something fast. We had been holding off doing a <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/pod-template/pull/33">big update</a> to the command because no-one knew what WWDC would bring. Now we know, so I've worked on a new version of the command that programmatically manipulates an example project via <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj">xcodeproj</a>. I've used it in creating all of these libraries. Expect to see it on the CocoaPods blog soon.</p>

<a name="Caveat"></a>
<h2>Caveat</h2>

<p>I built three libraries, but one of them is unique. I modelled Artsy+UIFonts from <a href="http://kylefuller.co.uk">Kyle Fuller</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/kylef/OpenSans-pod">OpenSans-pod</a>, where the CocoaPod has the font resources and installing it moves them into your project. This is great for a free or open-source font, but would break commercial font licenses. For that reason, we don't have the ability to open source that project. Thus Artsy Mobile's first closed-source library.</p>

<p>This is a great example of how you can build a private specs repo, whilst the public-private aspect is not applicable to most companies. I find it to be a nice halfway house between open source as default, and keeping something internal.

    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/06/17/building-the-xcode-plugin-snapshots</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm the kind of guy who thinks better tooling means better outcomes. But when good tooling isn't available, it's time to build it yourself. It's this attitude that lead to my work on <a href="http://cocoadocs.org">CocoaDocs.org</a>, and then to <a href="http://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods.org</a> &amp; its documentation.</p>

<p>We've been trying to apply this to testing, and in order to pull this off I've had to extend Xcode to show off the results of failing tests in a more visual way. To that end, I've extended Xcode to show the results of failing <a href="https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case">view tests</a> in a more visual way by building <a href="https://github.com/orta/snapshots">Snapshots for Xcode</a>.  Let's go through the process of building an Xcode plugin so you can do this too. Screw stability.</p>

<!-- more -->


<a name="Getting.started"></a>
<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>Lets start of with some Xcode inception. The nicest way to start working on Xcode plugins is to install <a href="http://alcatraz.io">Alcatraz</a> the Xcode plugin package manager:</p>

<pre><code>curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/supermarin/Alcatraz/master/Scripts/install.sh | sh
</code></pre>

<p>From Alcatraz you should have <a href="https://github.com/edwardaux/XcodeExplorer">XcodeExplorer</a> installed. This lets you dig through internal notifications and the Xcode view heriarchy for debugging. Then you'll want <a href="http://delisa.me">Delisa Mason</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/kattrali/Xcode5-Plugin-Template">Xcode 5 Plugin</a> template which also comes from Alcatraz. Now you can create a new project and pick <em>"Xcode 5 Plugin"</em>. This will do a bunch of the boring work around getting set up on a project, though it misses one bit that to me is essential, setting the Scheme Target. Once setup go to the Scheme editor and make it open Xcode as the target.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2014-06-17-building-the-xcode-plugin-snapshots/scheme.png" alt="Go set you target dangit" /></p>

<p>This means that when you do <code>cmd + r</code> on your project it will open a new instance of Xcode with your plugin installed, making the dev cycle for a plugin as simple as a normal OS X app. From here I can't tell you how to build your plugin. It's just normal development, however I can offer some general advice:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you see a class you don't know, google it, chances are Luis Solano has you covered with <a href="https://github.com/luisobo/Xcode-RuntimeHeaders">Xcode-RuntimeHeaders</a>.</li>
<li>Use id with fake class interfaces to get around having the headers for Xcode's classes.</li>
<li>Avoid 3rd party dependencies as much as possible as all plugin classes are in the same runtime.</li>
<li>A lot of work is done in notifications, so it's easy to hook in to state changes.</li>
<li>Swizzle as little as possible</li>
<li>Wrap code you're not 100% on with <code>@try {} @catch {}</code> once it's working to crash elegantly</li>
<li>Look at the source code of other plugins</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://github.com/kattrali/Xcode5-Plugin-Template#notes">the notes</a> on the Xcode5 Plugin Template</li>
</ul>


<a name="Releasing"></a>
<h2>Releasing</h2>

<p>Next up you want to get it on Alcatraz, this is just a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/supermarin/alcatraz-packages">alcatraz-packages repo</a>, it's like the old days of CocoaPods! Then you have a plugin, and people will always be using the master HEAD version of your plugin, so be wary around putting unstable code on that branch.</p>

<p>It's easy to forget that if you build apps you have all the tools you need to improve your workflow, one improvement that saves you an hour today could save thousands of human-hours once it's out in the community.</p>
