    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past year, our team started using a GraphQL orchestration layer that connects various APIs with multiple
front-end apps including <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/06/19/graphql-for-mobile">iOS</a>. It also handles caching
and extracts some business logic out of our client apps. This helped us not only to be more consistent with the way
we fetch data across apps, but also improved developer happiness and even bridged teams by having our web and iOS
developers work with the same API layer. This got me thinking what other problems GraphQL could solve at Artsy.</p>

<p>I work on the Publishing Team at Artsy, and we’ve recently been focused on page speed as a KPI. With so many ways
of measuring speed, it’s a daunting task but for this post, I’ll focus on the way we handled things on the
server-side and how integrating GraphQL on our API improved page speed.</p>

<h2 id="prior-to-graphql">Prior to GraphQL</h2>

<p>In our publishing CMS called <a href="http://github.com/artsy/positron">Positron</a>, we serve a separate API, database, and
front-end from the rest of the Artsy stack. We’re also responsible for the delivery and presentation of the content
itself. Over the past year we’ve focused a lot on how the content appears, and now we’ve opened up time to focus on
speed since in the land of content, every second counts.</p>

<p>Before we went ahead with adding a GraphQL-based endpoint to Positron, I spent about a week and refactoring our
current codebase. We refactored our router code to make less fetches, made better use of caching, and moved some
below-the-fold rendering into the client side. These are important steps towards a faster page, but it doesn’t push
our technology in a direction that lets us reimagine things.</p>

<h2 id="speed-issues">Speed Issues</h2>

<p>We split the speed problem in two: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Server Response Time</code> (server-side) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Document Interactive Time</code>
(client-side). We currently use Google Analytics to track these
<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2383341?hl=en">metrics</a>. There are some inaccuracies with GA such as
small sampling, geographic noise (countries with different download speeds), and timeouts being counted as zero,
but for our initial testing this will suffice for relative measuring.</p>

<h2 id="enter-graphql-and-joiql">Enter GraphQL and JoiQL</h2>

<p>Our very own <a href="https://twitter.com/craigspaeth">Craig Spaeth</a> recently started working on a project called
<a href="https://github.com/muraljs/mural">Mural</a>. It’s a framework for React and GraphQL. One library that came out of
this project is called <a href="http://github.com/muraljs/joiql">JoiQL</a>. It’s a The main purpose of JoiQL is to convert
<a href="http://github.com/hapijs/joi">Joi</a> schemas into GraphQL schemas.</p>

<p>We already use Joi in Positron so creating a GraphQL-based endpoint was trivial with JoiQL. Note that while JoiQL
is currently used in production, it’s still a beta project! Below is an example of how the JoiQL setup works.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see how simple it becomes to convert apps that already use Joi with JoiQL. Joi provides a nice API for
building GraphQL schemas with minimal boilerplate and we also get a nice Koa 2 style middleware pattern that lets
us hook into a downstream/upstream flow. This downstream/upstream flow could be useful later on if we were to get
really granular with measuring speed. For instance, if we decide to track the speed of the whole lifecycle of a
request, we could do something like this:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">api</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nx">ctx</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">next</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">startTIme</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">Date</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">now</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="nx">next</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">api</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nx">ctx</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">next</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// fetch content here</span>

<span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>The two features of GraphQL that have been helpful for reducing page speed are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reduced payload because you only request the data you need</li>
  <li>Multiple fetches can be coalesced into a single request</li>
</ol>

<p>Not surprisingly, decreased payload and coalesced requests are the same two features
<a href="http://twitter.com/orta">Orta</a> describes in part of his post on the killer features of
<a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/06/19/graphql-for-mobile">GraphQL for Mobile</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reduced-payload">Reduced Payload</h3>

<p>Reduced payload turned out to be one of the biggest factors in reducing speed. Just after October 27 we switched
over to using GraphQL on our <a href="http://m.artsy.net/articles">mobile articles landing page</a>.</p>

<p>&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<a href="/images/2016-11-02-improving-page-speed-with-graphql/download_time.png"><img src="/images/2016-11-02-improving-page-speed-with-graphql/download_time.png" /></a>&lt;div class='meta-container'&gt;&lt;header&gt; &lt;/header&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='date-container'&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='content-container'&gt;&lt;div class='entry-content'&gt;</p>

<p>Since we were previously getting back collection of articles with all of its content, rendering a simple page with
a list of articles meant the payload size was unnecessarily huge. Now, we only request a few things like the title
and image without having to do any extra work. This is especially important for mobile devices where we encounter
slow network speeds!</p>

<h3 id="multiple-fetches">Multiple fetches</h3>

<p>Although we haven’t made use of this in production yet, I anticipate that the ability to coalesce requests will be
significant. For example, to render an article page, there are up to five fetches that can be requested by our
front-end app with a normal REST API. Now, we can combine the requests to a single fetch, which moves the
responsibility of coalescing requests from aggregating slow HTTP requests to fanning out fast database queries. If
we aggregate the request and cache the response using a client like <a href="https://github.com/kadirahq/lokka">Lokka</a>, our
future looks bright.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>Besides making use of this new endpoint on all the things, I think the next big win with GraphQL is to add
<a href="http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations">mutations</a>. By adding support for mutations, we can modify our data
with GraphQL just as simply as we can query it.</p>

<p>We currently use a combination of Backbone and React to edit articles on our front-end CMS. After we move our CMS’s
data platform to GraphQL, we can move away from frameworks like Backbone and towards managing state containers like
Redux which are made to work with GraphQL. Features like revision history and undo events would feel natural with
state containers like Redux and a joy for our editors!</p>

<p>In the context of speed, some other topics I look forward to exploring are optimizing expensive database queries
and client-side asset compression.</p>
