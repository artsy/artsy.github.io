    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago we have started seeing the Heroku deployments of one of our applications randomly hang during <code>bundle install</code>. The problem worsened with time and we were not able to do a deployment for days.</p>

<p>```

```</p>

<p>Seeing bundler hang on "Fetching gem metadata from http://rubygems.org/", my immediate reaction was to blame the RubyGems Dependency API for its poor performance and attempt the <a href="http://hone.herokuapp.com/bundler%20heroku/2012/10/22/rubygems-and-the-dependency-api.html">recommended workaround</a> of switching to <em>http://bundler-api.herokuapp.com</em>. That didn't work.</p>

<p>I also tried to reproduce the issue on a local environment, including a (what I thought was) a completely clean machine at no avail. My <code>bundle install</code> would always succeed.</p>

<p>Finally, everything pointed at an infrastructure problem with Heroku itself, so I opened a ticket (#72648), <a href="https://twitter.com/dblockdotorg/status/290221530892365824">tweeted</a> endlessly to Heroku devs, pinged a  contact at Heroku on Skype and generally annoyed people for 5 straight days. It was a frustrating problem and I was getting no useful help.</p>

<p>Fast forward, this turned out to be <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/issues/2248">an issue in Bundler</a>. Narrowing it down would have been relatively easy if I had known where to look.</p>

<p>I hope this post helps you with similar issues.</p>

<h2>Heroku Slug Compiler</h2>

<p>Heroku provides small Ubuntu virtual machines on-demand, called "dynos", that look very much like any other Linux box. You can <code>heroku run bash</code> and examine the file system of a running dyno. You can delete the bundler cache, rerun <code>bundle install</code>, etc. But deployment does not happen in a running dyno - every time you push to Heroku, deployment happens inside a compiler dyno. Heroku attaches the dyno to your slug filesystem (your code), which may include a cache from previous runs. It then executes the code inside <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby">heroku-buildpack-ruby</a>, specifically <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby/blob/5dbf4c06c765dc832c073fe5be9360533fd1846d/lib/language_pack/ruby.rb#L49">this method</a>.</p>

<p>``` ruby
def compile
  Dir.chdir(build_path)
  remove_vendor_bundle
  install_ruby
  install_jvm
  setup_language_pack_environment
  setup_profiled
  allow_git do</p>

<pre><code>install_language_pack_gems
build_bundler
create_database_yml
install_binaries
run_assets_precompile_rake_task
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>A lot of these functions invoke <code>IO.open</code> and transmit <code>$stdout</code> and <code>$stderr</code> back to you. You see everything Heroku sees and while you cannot get access to the compiler dyno, there's really no mystery to this process. Heroku slug compiler will timeout after 15 minutes and produce a stack with <code>Utils::TimeoutError</code>. And everything Heroku does should be reproducible locally.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting Bundler</h2>

<p>The key to getting a repro of my issue locally was to use the <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/blob/master/ISSUES.md">Bundler Troubleshooting</a> section. I had previously missed one of the steps in cleaning the local Bundler cache.</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>remove user-specific gems and git repos</h1>

<p>rm -rf ~/.bundle/ ~/.gem/bundler/ ~/.gems/cache/bundler/</p>

<h1>remove system-wide git repos and git checkouts</h1>

<p>rm -rf $GEM_HOME/bundler/ $GEM_HOME/cache/bundler/</p>

<h1>remove project-specific settings and git repos</h1>

<p>rm -rf .bundle/</p>

<h1>remove project-specific cached .gem files</h1>

<p>rm -rf vendor/cache/</p>

<h1>remove the saved resolve of the Gemfile</h1>

<p>rm -rf Gemfile.lock</p>

<h1>uninstall the rubygems-bundler and open_gem gems</h1>

<p>rvm gemset use global # if using rvm
gem uninstall rubygems-bundler open_gem</p>

<h1>try to install one more time</h1>

<p>bundle install
```</p>

<p>This hung with my Gemfile the same way as on Heroku.</p>

<h2>Bundler Dependency Resolver</h2>

<p>So what is bundler doing?</p>

<p>Bundler runs the gem dependency resolver, which is described in detail in <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2011/9/24/how-does-bundler-bundle">Pat Shaughnessy's blog post</a>. The post suggests running <code>DEBUG_RESOLVER=1 bundle install</code>, which produced a mountain of output that isn't very helpful.</p>

<p>I made a <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/pull/2249">pull request</a> with a similar setting called <code>DEBUG_RESOLVER_TREE</code>, which reduces the output to the gems being resolved. This helped me narrow down a <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/issues/2248">small repro</a>. I was also able to make some sense of what bundler was doing: backtracking in an attempt to find a combination of gems matching the versions declared in <code>Gemfile</code> for every combinations of <code>railties</code>, <code>actionmailer</code>, <code>activeresource</code>, <code>activerecord</code>, <code>actionpack</code> and <code>builder</code> above version 3.2, only to fail to find a compatible version of <code>builder</code> every single time. That's a lot of versions to try.</p>

<p>Adding an entry for <code>builder</code> to <code>Gemfile</code> fixed the issue.</p>

<p>Similar issues to my <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/issues/2248">#2248</a> in Bundler have been reported in <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/issues/2030">#2030</a>, <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/issues/2090">#2090</a> and <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/issues/2125">#2125</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/12/13/beat-heroku-60-seconds-application-boot-timeout-with-a-proxy/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-13T21:21:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/12/13/beat-heroku-60-seconds-application-boot-timeout-with-a-proxy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2012-12-13-beat-heroku-60-seconds-application-boot-timeout-with-a-proxy/heroku-logo-light-234x60.png"></p>

<p>Heroku will log an <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/error-codes#r10-boot-timeout">R10 - Boot Timeout</a> error when a web process takes longer than 60 seconds to bind to its assigned port. This error is often caused by a process being unable to reach an external resource, such as a database or because you have a lot of gems in your <code>Gemfile</code> which take a long time to load.</p>

<p><code>
Dec 12 12:12:12 prod heroku/web.1:
  Error R10 (Boot timeout)
  Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 60 seconds of launch
</code></p>

<p>There's currently no way to increase this boot timeout, but we can beat it with a proxy implemented by our new <a href="https://github.com/dblock/heroku-forward">heroku-forward</a> gem.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The concepts for <code>heroku-forward</code> come from <a href="http://noverloop.be/beating-herokus-60s-boot-times-with-the-cedar-stack-and-a-reverse-proxy/">this article</a> by Nicolas Overloop. The basic idea is to have a proxy bind to the port immediately and then buffer requests until the backend came up. The proxy implementation is Ilya Grigorik's <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/em-proxy">em-proxy</a>. Communication between the proxy and the backend happens over a unix domain socket (a file), which needed a bit of work (see <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/em-proxy/pull/31">#31</a>), inspired by an excellent article, <a href="http://jgwmaxwell.com/fighting-the-unicorns-becoming-a-thin-wizard-on-heroku">Fighting the Unicorns: Becoming a Thin Wizard on Heroku</a> by JGW Maxwell. The <code>heroku-forward</code> gem connects all the dots.</p>

<p>Check out the gem's <a href="https://github.com/dblock/heroku-forward/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for how to set it up.</p>

<p>Here's the log output from an application that uses this gem. Notice that Heroku reports the state of <code>web.1</code> up after just 4 seconds, while the application takes 67 seconds to boot.</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/11/29/measuring-performance-in-grape-apis-with-new-relic/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Knowing how well your API performs in real time is essential to any successful project. That's because you can't fix what you can't measure.</p>

<p>We use and heavily contribute to <a href="http://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a>, a Ruby API DSL. Grape is a Rack middleware and we have been reporting API performance data to <a href="http://newrelic.com/">NewRelic</a> with code from <a href="http://code.dblock.org/new-relic-performance-instrumentation-with-grape-api">my older blog post</a>.</p>

<p>It's time to improve the reporting implementation and address performance monitoring in both development and production environments. Here's what a single API request breakdown is going to look like.</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2012-11-29-measuring-performance-in-grape-apis-with-new-relic/transaction-detail.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>NewRelic RPM</h2>

<p>The first step is to add the <code>newrelic_rpm</code> gem to Gemfile, which implements the actual realtime performance reporting to NewRelic. We also use <a href="https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid">Mongoid</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mongoid/moped">Moped</a> MongoDB Ruby driver, which can be instrumented with <code>newrelic_moped</code>.</p>

<p><code>ruby Gemfile
gem "newrelic_moped", "0.0.3"
gem "newrelic_rpm", "3.3.3"
</code></p>

<p>You will need <code>config/newrelic.yml</code> in your application. Ours can be found in <a href="https://gist.github.com/4170458">this gist</a> and works well both locally and on Heroku.</p>

<h2>Instrumenting Grape</h2>

<p>In the past we used <a href="https://gist.github.com/1233422">NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::API</a>, which works for any generic Rack middleware. This would report all API calls to NewRelic, but would treat requests to <em>/api/artist/andy-warhol</em> and <em>/api/artist/wassily-kandinsky</em> as unrelated. That is because the instrumenter is a Rack middleware that wraps Grape requests <em>before</em> they reach Grape. The only information available is the request URL, and not the actual API route that is going to be matched when the request is processed.</p>

<p>We want both requests to <em>/api/artist/andy-warhol</em> and <em>/api/artist/wassily-kandinsky</em> to be treated as <em>/api/artist/:id</em>. Lets insert a middleware inside Grape itself, once the URL has been matched to a route.</p>

<p><code>ruby api.rb
class API &lt;&lt; Grape::API
  use ApiNewRelicInstrumenter
  ...
end
</code></p>

<p>The new instrumenter has access to the current API endpoint via <code>env['api.endpoint']</code> and reports data via NewRelic's <code>ControllerInstrumentation</code>.</p>

<p>``` ruby
class ApiNewRelicInstrumenter &lt; Grape::Middleware::Base
  include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation</p>

<p>  def call(env)</p>

<pre><code>trace_options = {
  category: :rack,
  path: env['api.endpoint'].routes.first.route_path,
  request: request,
  ...
}

perform_action_with_newrelic_trace(trace_options) do
  yield
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The complete code for <code>ApiNewRelicInstrumenter</code> can be found in <a href="https://gist.github.com/4170469">this gist</a>. It supports enabling and disabling performance reporting by setting <code>NEW_RELIC_ID</code> and works around NewRelic's method name limitations (these cannot contain slashes).</p>

<h2>Development Environment</h2>

<p>You can now see NewRelic performance data in development mode, too. If you mount Grape inside Rails run <code>NEW_RELIC_ID=foo rails s</code>. Navigate to <em>http://localhost:3000/newrelic</em> to see your local traces.</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2012-11-29-measuring-performance-in-grape-apis-with-new-relic/developer-mode.png"></p>

<p>Drill into an individual request to find several detailed breakdowns of how time was spent, including specific MongoDB queries (under "SQL", naturally).</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2012-11-29-measuring-performance-in-grape-apis-with-new-relic/sql-detail.png"></p>

<p>NewRelic is a commercial product, but you can run development mode for free! Note that enabling this will triple your local Rails boot time: we enable development mode by setting <code>development_mode: &lt;%= !!ENV['NEW_RELIC_ID'] %&gt;</code> in <a href="https://gist.github.com/4170458">newrelic.rpm</a>.</p>
