    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fair compensation is an important part of cultivating and growing engineers, and determining how much money someone is going to make is often more art than science, especially in young start-ups. We wanted this to be a collaborative process and not an adversarial one, and as our engineering team grew past 20 members it became important to think about compensation more systematically.</p>

<p>In this post I will share our individual contributor engineering ladder and our performance evaluation and compensation process.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Performance evaluation at Artsy is composed of the <em>what</em>, i.e. what you achieve that contributes to your team’s goals and ultimately Artsy goals, and the <em>how</em>, i.e. how you act and how those actions  contribute to Artsy’s culture and values. The <em>what</em> part for an engineer is expressed in our individual contributor ladder, which describes typical growth from someone who has recently graduated, to an inspiring technologist. There’s nothing typical to engineering in our team - we have more art degrees than computer science ones, and I find all our junior engineers incredibly inspiring. This ladder is a benchmark, not a formula - knowing what’s typical helps team leads highlight the exceptional achievements and individuals to find themselves in a traditional growth path and figure out what their next step could be. It’s also important to note that our ladder recognizes that individual contributors do not need to become team leads to make more money - individual contributors are the most important people at Artsy and there’s no ceiling in their career here. We also are working on a company-wide system for team leads, but that’s a subject for another post.</p>

<p>We have devised 5 levels, much inspired by the excellent <a href="http://dresscode.renttherunway.com/blog/ladder">Rent-the-Runway’s Engineering Ladder</a>. You’ll find it at the end of this article.</p>

<p>Armed with this list a team lead can have a good 1:1 conversation with a team member about where they are in their career in terms of pure performance, and what areas need be paid attention to in order to grow into the next level. Leads can also compare engineers that don’t work on their teams using a consistent vocabulary.</p>

<p>In parallel with working on this ladder, we did a lot of research regarding market compensation for Engineers. We routinely ask candidates questions about their pay and competitive offers, discuss this with  heads of engineering in other companies, use market data from large recruiting firms and pay attention to polls in the various technology organizations. We understand regional differences and have a good idea of the ranges that a company similar to Artsy pays individuals and constantly update our knowledge. If you run a team and would like to compare your numbers to ours, please e-mail <a href="mailto:db@artsy.net">db@artsy.net</a>.</p>

<p>A significant portion of your compensation comes in Artsy stock options. However, we do not assign dollar value to those or consider them to do compensation math, other than for the case when we offer you a range of possible salaries and a range of possible stock compensation. We often let you choose high equity and low cash, or low equity and high cash, which shifts down or up your target market value by the difference in dollars between your choice and fair market compensation. We determine the amount of stock options at the time of your joining and you may also receive subsequent grants with the goal of always providing you a fair amount of stock appropriate to your ladder at the moment of the grant.</p>

<p>We review compensation every six months. And so, how do we determine your actual pay? We identify your ladder level, which yields your fair market value. Your lead then considers how you act and how those actions contribute to Artsy’s culture and values. This determines whether you are paid an amount that’s market high, or maybe even above market, creating a good margin to work with for exceptional achievements, strong progress or impact outside of your primary responsibilities.</p>

<p>We test our framework when making new offers by asking candidates what their compensation expectations are. Some will give a number above their fair market value and we’ll offer them less. Some will give a number below their fair market value and we’ll offer them more. You read that right - people are paramount at Artsy - we do make offers above what a candidate may be asking for, based on our data and compensation framework. But don’t take our word for it, e-mail us your resume to <a href="jobs@artsy.net">jobs@artsy.net</a>.</p>
