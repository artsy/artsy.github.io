        <p>Artsy's New York HQ occupies four top floors of <a href="http://401broadway.com">401 Broadway</a>, located in historic Tribeca at the intersection of Broadway &amp; Canal St., famous for its sellers of fake designer bags. Five elevators carry you up to our breathtaking views, albeit slowly.</p>

<p>Despite having been fully rebuilt in the last few years these machines are simply too few for the too many people working in the building. The lobby gets packed in the morning. The floors are crowded with coworkers waiting for an elevator to go to lunch around noon. Elevators make all local stops.</p>

<p>Because everything is a technology problem, I decided to improve this situation during our fall hackathon by building a Slack bot to call the elevator. Slack it, keep working for a few minutes, then dash out when you hear the elevator "ding", collectively gaining hours of productivity!</p>

        <p><em>Note: This is the text of a presentation given at <a href="https://graphql-finland.fi">GraphQL Finland 2018</a>, as such the
language may in some cases be slightly awkward for a blog post. You can find those slides on
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/alloy/where-art-thou-my-error">Speaker Deck</a>.</em></p>

<p>GraphQL is still in its early stages and thus these are very exciting times, indeed! Traditionally the GraphQL team
has taken the approach of defining the bare minimum in the specification that was deemed needed and otherwise
letting the community come-up with defining problems and experimenting with solutions for those. One such example
is how metadata about the location in the graph where errors occurred during execution were <a href="https://github.com/facebook/graphql/pull/230">added to the
specification</a>.</p>

<p>This is great in the sense that we still have the ability, as a community, to shape the future of a GraphQL
specification that we all <em>want</em> to use, but on the other hand it also means that we may need to spend significant
amounts of time on thinking about these problems and iterating. Seeing as we all strive to have backwards
compatible schemas, it’s of great importance that we know of the various iterations that people have experimented
with and what the outcome was.</p>

<p>This is our story of thinking about and working with errors, thus far.</p>

        <p><em>Why pair program? As new engineers join Artsy, we've been experimenting with different programming cultures - Yuki
came from Pivotal Labs where they have a strong pair programming culture and introduced it at Artsy - it's been
about a year and a half and we're all really loving the changes he's introduced.</em></p>

<p><em>I asked Yuki if he'd pair program with me on a blog, post on Pair Programming, and this is it. He's going to
dive into what pair programming is, why you should do it, what are good mental models to think about, the techniques
you can use to make it work, what hardware you might need and how Yuki persuaded so many of us to start doing it
more often.</em></p>

        <p>Engineering is an inherently long-term process. The Artsy engineering team has been around for 7 years, and that's
quite a lot of time to get things done. We use software that keeps track of changes over time thanks to source
control, but tools like git only help keep track of small passages of time. I want to keep track of events that
could take months to ship.</p>

<p>We've been doing a lot of long-term introspection as a team in 2018. Externally, this has been visible through
things like opening our docs and creating our engineering principles. I'm expanding on this with an idea that I
took from my work in building large open source projects: <a href="https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/highlights.md#readme">Highlight docs</a>.</p>

        <p>As Artsy Engineering grows in 2018, we have so many newcomers looking for context: they want to understand the
systems they'll be working in day-to-day. Awesome! But it's not enough to understand the systems themselves, it's
often helpful to understand the <em>history</em> of how we ended up where we are.</p>

<p>Frontend web development has changed a <em>lot</em> during Artsy's existence, and it continues to advance at a blistering
pace. It's easy to get caught up in the churn of frameworks and languages and tools, so I want to use this post as
an opportunity to contextualize each transition that Artsy's web presence has made over the past seven years. We've
changed technologies, but we've tried to do so with care and attention. Documenting these decisions is important
(and is ideally done <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/contemporaneous-blogging/">contemporaneously</a>), but even with the best documentation, <a href="https://github.com/artsy/artsy.github.io/pull/489#discussion_r221301472">sometimes our own documentation
is unclear to us</a>.</p>

<p>In an effort to help contextualize our web frontend (which is <a href="https://github.com/artsy/force">open source</a>), this blog post will document
the major transitions that Artsy's web presence has made over the past seven years. Let's begin!</p>

        <p>For what feels like the last 3-6 months, I've been trying to figure out how to know what the commit is for the
Docker runtime in Peril. Roughly: every master commit on Peril triggers a Docker image on Docker Hub for the
environment in which JavaScript is running. There's a lag between creating the commit, having the image ready on
Docker Hub, and Peril using the new image. There's also space for these automated systems to go wrong, so I'd like
to be able to be certain in logging.</p>

<p>I've thrown a lot of commits and time every few weeks at this, so now that I've figured it out, I'll give you an
idea of what I needed to do to make it work in a micro-post.</p>

        <p>Hey there! My name is Anson and I work on the Platform team at Artsy. Recently, we faced an issue where a certain
<a href="https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme">Enzyme</a> test we wrote using mock tracking was failing, but we couldn't figure
out why. Luckily, with some help from <a href="/author/orta">Orta</a> and some clever thinking, we figured out what was going
on.</p>

In this blog post, I'd like to use our experience of defining these to answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why define engineering guiding principles?</li>
<li>What makes principles different from company values?</li>
<li>How to define guiding principles?</li>
</ul>


<p>Let's dive in.</p>

        <p>Artsy is growing up. We have thousands of subscriber galleries paying 3 to 4 figure monthly fees. As we're starting
to see a real market-fit, and have started to mature our organization. For example, this year we introduced product
managers into our 8 year old company to help us figure out how to build the right things. We actually started having
open headcount on Engineering again, for the first time <em>in years</em>.</p>

<p>As a part of maturing, our team has really had to start considering how to make parts of our culture explicit
instead of implicit. We have new, awesome folks wanting to understand why things are the way they are as well as
folk who are raising up to new responsibilities only to find them completely un-documented.</p>

<p>In-part, having a consistent team for so long hasn't made it worth the time to document things everyone knows, but
growth is very happy to disrupt that balance. Now we're shipping documentation updates weekly, to all sorts of
places. In trying to write an awesome document, which I'll cover later, I looked at how we had consolidated our
documentation over the last few years, and saw that we had fragmented due the tensions around wanting to write
publicly.</p>

<p>This post covers that tension, and how we came about to the new docs setup.</p>

        <p>Programming generally requires getting into a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow state</a> and working on a tricky problem for some time.
In the last 2 years, most of my work at Artsy (and in the OSS world) has been less about longer-term building of
hard things, but working on many smaller tasks across a lot of different areas.</p>

<p>Somehow, during this period I managed to end up in the top of "most active" <a href="https://gist.github.com/paulmillr/2657075">GitHub members</a>, I feel like a
lot of this is due to doing <a href="http://artsy.github.io/series/open-source-by-default/">Open Source by Default</a> at Artsy and second to being good at context switching. I
want to try and talk though some of my techniques for handling context switching, as well as a bit of philosophy
around adopting and owning your tools.</p>
