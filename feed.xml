        <title>Two years of Next.js at Artsy: A Retrospective</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Where to begin! Where to begin…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets start with a good measure of success, one that I think most engineers could
agree on: a from-scratch rebuild of a complex, internal tools app. Success with
rebuilds is often fleeting, as many can attest. There’s risk involved. Extending
the challenge further, lets assign (most) of the task to a team of platform
engineers who aren’t too familiar with modern front-end technology – and then
say that we succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Artsy crazy? Or is Next.js (along with our team 🙂) just that good? Well,
it’s a little of both. And it’s a little bittersweet, in a way. Here’s our tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beginnings&quot;&gt;Beginnings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first formal use of Next came from a project spun up during Hackathon, two
years ago. Hackathon’s are great opportunities to push technology forward, and
Artsy has had a lot of success with them. We’d been talking about Next.js for a
while, and experimenting here and there, but we were never able to find the
proper intersection of product and purpose to take things further. With this in
mind, one of our Engineers (Roop 👋) spun up a Next.js POC that allowed us to
deduplicate artist records. On the surface, the effort was non-trivial. It
involved authentication, DB communication, and more. Yet when presented during
Hackathon, all of this was done and it also looked &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could so much product work get completed in such a short period of time? A
large part of that is due to Next.js’s framework design, and how it simply gets
out of the way and allows one to start building product features. The defaults
made sense; to create a new route, simply create a new folder or file in the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; directory, and Next takes care of the rest. And what about compilation,
TypeScript, linting, and all of the other extraordinarily confusing JavaScript
toolchain details that folks typically struggle over? (Most) of the setup was
taken care of at the framework level, and the API side of things was light and
easy to understand, thanks to great documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are omitted details of course, and there were things we needed to figure
out (such as auth, via &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;next-auth&lt;/code&gt;, and passing runtime ENV secrets to our
Dockerized container), but in any case this gave us a lot of confidence to start
discussing what it might take to seriously consider rebuilding our internal
tools app. A few meetings later it was decided, and our platform team agreed to
take it (with loose backup support from a couple other engineers). And a few
short month’s later much of the core functionality was complete, executed by a
team working amidst unfamiliar terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the definition of success, and the measure. With our internal tools app
complete it was natural to start looking around for other opportunities – but
first, a quick detour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enter-next-13-aka-the-app-router&quot;&gt;Enter: Next 13 (aka, The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; Router)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the limitations of Next 12 are well known, with the most notable ones
being the inability to (naturally) do page layouts along with quirks around
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getServerSideProps&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_app&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_document&lt;/code&gt; request fetching not being as
flexible as one would like. These issues, however, were not &lt;em&gt;deal-breakers&lt;/em&gt;; and
in fact, we hardly even noticed them. Our page layouts simply rendered a shared
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Layout&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component that accepted &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;children&lt;/code&gt;; and per-route data fetching
requested data per-route, with globally shared data going in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_app&lt;/code&gt;. It got the
job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these things in mind (and a few things more), many of us were extremely
excited when Next released its
&lt;a href=&quot;https://nextjs.org/blog/layouts-rfc&quot;&gt;Layouts RFC&lt;/a&gt;, outlining the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; version
of Next.js, which would be built on top of another long-anticipated React.js
feature,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html&quot;&gt;React Server Components&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the Layouts RFC outlined what looked to be a beautifully obvious, yet
performant architecture. Using Next’s preference for file-system based
configuration, a typical “page” could soon look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;- app/
---- layout.tsx
---- page.tsx
- app/artist
---- layout.tsx
---- page.tsx
---- middleware.tsx
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so on. “Global” SSR data could be fetched right there in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;layout&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;page&lt;/code&gt;
and shared with its subtree; and likewise, for sub-sub-tree’s we could do the
same in each individual app &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;layout&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, with React Server Components, we would no longer need to use many
Next.js-specific APIs. To fetch data on the server, you simply &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; a promise
and pass it right to your component as props. Next’s already minimal API
footprint would diminish even further, and it became possible to glean a vision
of “just vanilla JS” all the way down, and within that vision the possibility of
true simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little did we know, it wouldn’t take much to turn this beautiful vision into
something of a dilemma, but that part of the story comes a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expanding-nextjs-at-artsy&quot;&gt;Expanding Next.js at Artsy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming off of our success with the internal tools app rebuild, we wanted more.
And we didn’t need to look far: right around the corner was a ~10 year old
external CMS app that our partners use to manage their inventory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided the path forward was Next, and like our internal tools app rebuild,
for the most part it has been a success. We again went with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; router
(as the new &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; router wasn’t yet released) and so far there’s been minimal
confusion from the team. And buisness-wise, its been refreshing to defer
framework design decisions, lib upgrades and more to Next, versus having to
maintain &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/force&quot;&gt;all of these things in-house&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth mentioning that there &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been a few significant challenges
involved (such as setting up performant SSR patterns for using Relay, our
GraphQL client – thats another blog post), but on the whole Next has served our
needs well. Team performance was unlocked, and we’ve been able to quickly get to
building and rebuilding CMS pages in this new application. And our engineers
have loved working in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-to-next-13&quot;&gt;Back to Next 13&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Next 13 was released. Imagine our excitement! Just as this new
app is spinning up we receive a little gift from the stars. Carlos and I are the
first ones to bite; lets see what migrating our work over to the new framework
might look like, what kind of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the start, it was immediately obvious that the Next.js team released an
alpha-quality (or less) product, marked as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt;. Not a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beta&lt;/code&gt;, not an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RC&lt;/code&gt;
to peruse and experiment with, but rather an&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;next
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;package that comes with an application scaffold generator that suggests using
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; router over &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; – marked as &lt;em&gt;“Recommended”&lt;/em&gt;. In other words,
highly polished. And what’s the first thing one experiences?
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=next+13+hot+reloading+broken+site:github.com&amp;amp;sca_esv=b6c25dbec4ffd71b&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjlmtTR_eKEAxW4CjQIHTqPAJYQrQIoBHoECBgQBQ&amp;amp;biw=1512&amp;amp;bih=829&amp;amp;dpr=2#ip=1&quot;&gt;Hot Reloading is broken&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what’s the next thing? Styles are broken. It turns out that RSC (React
Server Components) doesn’t fully support pre-existing CSS-in-JS patterns. Or
rather,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js#styled-components&quot;&gt;they do, kind of&lt;/a&gt;,
but they can only be used inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;use client&lt;/code&gt; components (which, in Next.js,
actually means a server-side rendered component environment that’s &lt;em&gt;separate
from&lt;/em&gt; a RSC rendered “server-only” environment – aka the old pages router
model). And we certainly weren’t about to throw out our Design System component
library &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/palette&quot;&gt;Palette&lt;/a&gt;, which has been nothing but
a runaway success (and a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/palette-mobile&quot;&gt;highly portable one&lt;/a&gt; at that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this limitation, our ability to use React Server Components had been
severely hampered. Excluding the root-most level of our component tree, we were
now required to prepend &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;use client&lt;/code&gt; on the top of every component, lest we
receive ambiguous errors about rendering a client component (which used to be
server-side render safe) on the “RSC server”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things can be taught, however. So lets proceed from the assumption that through
some kind of tooling / linting layer, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;use client&lt;/code&gt; is added to every new
component. It &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; behave at that point just like the old Next and now we
get the best of both worlds. Nope: turns out that even with the CSS-in-JS setup
instructions described in the the next docs above, we still run into issues.
There are bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(These are the two main red flags, but there are many others as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we wisely back out. It’s only &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;next@13.0.0&lt;/code&gt;, and what they’re
doing here is to a certain extent revolutionary. It’s a new way of thinking
about React, yet an old way of thinking about page rendering. It’s like… PHP,
or so they say. RSC is &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;, there’s something to it. Lets give them
the benefit of the doubt and return to things in a few months, after a few
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;minor&lt;/code&gt; version bumps; there are, after all, countless eyes on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;many-months-later&quot;&gt;Many Months Later&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npx create-next-app@latest&lt;/code&gt; (this is around the time they release
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;13.4&lt;/code&gt;) and then add these two components inside the newly-created vanilla
project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-tsx highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// app/HelloClient.tsx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;use client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HelloClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Does this hot reload&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// app/layout.tsx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HelloClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;./HelloClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;HelloClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything renders. And then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-tsx highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HelloClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Does this hot reload... nope :(&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the most basic project setup, the most obvious Next.js selling point –
Developer Experience – failed to deliver. Vercel is really forcing us to
question things. But we’re flexible, and we like to investigate at Artsy, so
even though this definitely-required feature doesn’t quite work, maybe it will
once we’re done with our migration spike, and maybe we can still take advantage
of everything else that RSC has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, we start refactoring the project. Stuff from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; directory
starts getting copied over to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app&lt;/code&gt;. We update configuration. We setup styling
(it seems to work better). Things are &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; there. But then the obscure
framework errors start to arrive, and CSS still doesn’t quite work: it turns out
that refactoring across RSC-&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;use client&lt;/code&gt; boundaries is harder than one thought.
I.e., if any piece of “client” (remember, ‘use client’ actually means SSR-safe)
code &lt;em&gt;anywhere in the dependency tree&lt;/em&gt; happens to intersect an RSC boundary, the
whole thing will fail. And this includes any use of React’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;createContext&lt;/code&gt; –
because React Context’s aren’t supported. Given an app of any reasonable size,
you’re likely to rely on a context somewhere, as context’s are so critical
within the react hooks model of behavior. Said contexts might come from within
your app, and if not there they’ll certainly come from a 3rd party library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would expect the errors to be helpful in tracking this down – Next.js is
all about DX – but no. Confusion reigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re experts though, and we eventually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; find the source of the violation,
and we make sure to create a “safety wrapper” around the offender so that it
doesn’t happen again. But it does happens again – and again, any time any piece
of any complexity is added in the new RSC-intersected route. It’s rather
unavoidable. And each time solvable, but at a great cost to the developer.
Thankfully we know what we’re doing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trivial yet annoying issue (thankfully fixed with some custom eslint
config) is accidentally importing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;useRouter&lt;/code&gt; hook from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; router
location, or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;redirect&lt;/code&gt;, or any number of other new &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; router features,
because all of these things don’t work in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt;, and will error out. The
errors here are slightly less opaque, but what if you’re a backend dev who knows
nothing about any of this? Googling “useRouter next” now yields two sets of
docs. Figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*Sce5egkhwWpCeqF0.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we make a judgement call: this simply isn’t going to work at
Artsy. We’re here to empower folks and unlock productivity. Remember the team of
DevOps engineers on Platform who rebuilt a CMS in record time? In the new Next
13 model, that would be unfathomable, impossible even. Paper cuts would kill
motivation, and dishearten the already skeptical. And the front end already has
a bad rap, for good reason: historically, everything that seems like it should
be easy is hard and confusing for those who aren’t experts. And everything is
always changing. And the tooling is always breaking. And everybody always has a
bright new idea, one that will finally end this madness for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A certain amount of sadness is appropriate here, because Next’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; router
was very, very close to being the silver bullet for web applications that we’ve
all been looking for. Even though the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; router has its flaws, it showed us
that it’s possible to get something out the door very quickly with little prior
knowledge of Front End development. This is no small thing. Next 13’s fatal
error is that its destiny, being coupled to RSC, now requires experts. And by
‘expert’ I mean: those with many years of experience dealing with JavaScript’s
whims, its complex eco-system, its changeover, as well as its problems. In
short, folks who have become numb to it all. This is no way to work.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1abd6wm/hitler_tried_rsc_and_next_14/&quot;&gt;Thankfully the community is finally responding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-quick-note-on-performance&quot;&gt;A Quick Note on Performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth remembering that Next 12 was industry-leading in terms of performance
and pioneered many innovative solutions. Let me say it again: Next’s pages
router IS fast. Next 13 combined with RSC &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; faster, but at what point does an
obsession with performance start negating other crucial factors? What’s good for
the 90%? And what’s required for the other 10%? Most companies just need
something that’s fast enough – and easy enough – to &lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt; fast. And not much
more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-at-artsy&quot;&gt;Back At Artsy…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of this in mind, and with the uncertainty around long-term support for
Next.js &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; (amongst other things), we recently decided to hit pause on
future development in our new external CMS app rebuild. Weighing a few different
factors (many entirely unrelated to Next), including a team reorg that allowed
us to look more closely (and fix) the DX in our old external CMS app, we took a
step back and recognized that our needs are actually quite minimal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instant hot reloading&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fast, SPA-like UX performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simple, convention-based file organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these things covered, the “web framework” layer looks something like the
following, minus a few underlying router lib details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-tsx highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;/foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lazy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;./Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;/bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lazy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;./Bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now required to manage our compiler config, but
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shakacode/shakapacker&quot;&gt;that layer&lt;/a&gt; isn’t too complicated
once its setup, and it works great. (If you’re using something like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Vite&lt;/code&gt;, it
could be even simpler.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next 13 and React Server Components are very intriguing; it’s a new model of
thinking that folks are still trying to work out. Like other revolutionary
technologies released by Meta, sometimes it takes a few years to catch on, and
maybe RSC is firmly in that bucket. Vercel, however, would do well to remember
Next’s original fundamental insight – that all good things follow from
developer experience. Improvements there tend to improve things everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to fixing some of the obvious rough edges in the new &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; router,
it would be helpful if Next could provide an official response to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/56655&quot;&gt;the question of long-term Pages support&lt;/a&gt;.
There’s been quite a backlash in the community against Next 13, and that should
give all developers pause. It’d also be great to get word on whether there will
be any further development on the pages router – perhaps some of the features
from the new &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; router can be migrated to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; as well? – or if the pages
router is officially deprecated and locked. All of this is currently ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where Next could improve is their willingness to ship buggy
features, and to rely on patched versions of React in order to achieve certain
ends. Even though Vercel employs many members of the React Core team, by
releasing Next versions that rely on patched and augmented &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;canary&lt;/code&gt; builds of
React, Vercel is effectively compromising some of React’s integrity, and forcing
their hand. Once a neo-React feature is added to Next, it makes it hard to say
no; Next has captured too much of the market-share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this calls for sobriety and hesitation on the part of developers working
with – and building companies on top of – Vercel’s products. Next is Open
Source, yes, but it’s also a wildcard. Artsy has had some real success with
Next, but sometimes that’s just not enough to avoid hitting pause, and looking
at the bigger picture. Inclusivity should always win.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Checklist for Deploying a Scary Change</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been getting involved with some sketchy stuff. You know what I’m
talking about–data migrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been rolling out changes that have a significant risk of breaking our
production environment for mission-critical services. It’s been exciting work
(keep your eyes out for more posts on the exact project, coming soon™️), but
I’ve definitely caused a couple incidents along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After accidentally taking down a key service for a couple hours, I decided I
needed to have a better pre-deploy process for these changes. I did some
thinking and came up with a short checklist to run through before I press the
shiny green button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the checklist I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;What is your plan if something goes wrong?
    &lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Run through ramifications of rolling back. If there’s a reason you’re
    worried about rolling back, then you’re not ready to deploy the change
    yet!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Figure out exactly what command(s) you will need to run to roll back. At
    Artsy, this is usually a
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/hokusai/blob/main/docs/Command_Reference.md#how-to-do-a-rollback&quot;&gt;one-liner using Hokusai&lt;/a&gt;,
    our command-line Docker/Kubernetes CLI&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;How will you tell if something is going wrong after you deploy?
    &lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Error rate (DataDog)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Specific error reporting (Sentry)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Latency (DataDog)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Logs (Papertrail)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Functionality (does it still work? Are people using it successfully?
    Important for things where errors may not be bubbled up correctly or
    reported immediately)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Sidekiq (are there lots of jobs queued to retry that are failing?)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this checklist in hand, I’m deploying more confidently and causing fewer
incidents along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have something similar? Are there things you think this checklist should
include? Let me know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TypeScript magic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At Artsy, we love TypeScript. We use it in most of our node/web/mobile repos.
Today, I want to talk about a specific case we found while trying to make our
types more strict on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/palette-mobile&quot;&gt;palette-mobile&lt;/a&gt;,
which is our Design System for React Native.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check this out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;welp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// `welp` is of type `string`.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the comment says, even though we have two specific strings, the fact that
we do a union with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, makes &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;welp&lt;/code&gt; have a type of just &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;. This is
because both &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt; are strings, and the union tends to go to
the type that includes the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of set theory and bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2023-02-20-typescript-magic/hello-world.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is a type by itself, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is a type by itself. Unioning them
together gives us a new type, which is a bubble that contains both &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. In that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot; | &quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt; union bubble, we see both &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt; types as subsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; bubble contains all strings, so it contains &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot; | &quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, so the union of them with string is string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2023-02-20-typescript-magic/string.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is usually ok, but for our case, it didn’t work. Here is what we wanted to
do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our Design System, we have certain color, named like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;black100&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;black80&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blue100&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;red150&lt;/code&gt; etc. We can have a type like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ColorDSValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;black100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;black80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;blue100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;red150&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// | etc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and that works great. We get to have autocomplete, typechecking, all the good
stuff that TypeScript brings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we also want to support any other string, like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;#000000&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;#000&quot;&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;rgb(0,0,0)&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;rgba(0,0,0,0.5)&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hsl(0,0%,0%)&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hsla(0,0%,0%,0.5)&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.
Ok, you might say, just make more types like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ColorHexValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ColorRGBValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`rgb(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;)`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ColorRGBAValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`rgba(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;)`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ColorHSLValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`hsl(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;%,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;%)`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and so on. That’s great. So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also want to make sure CSS color names are accepted. So then we add something
like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ColorCSSString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;hotpink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// | etc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and now we have a type with all the values. That seemed ok, but it also felt a
bit too much. If CSS names change, we need to update. Also what we wanted to do
is actually have autocomplete and typechecking for our DS values, and just leave
it loose for all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we tried&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ColorDSValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;black100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;black80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;blue100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;red150&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// | etc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ColorOtherString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ColorDSValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ColorOtherString&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but we ended up with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt; being just &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, which automatically means no
autocomplete and no typechecking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;now-check-this-out&quot;&gt;Now check this out!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;wow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// `wow` is of type `&quot;hello&quot;` or `&quot;world&quot;` or `string`.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weird-looking intersection of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string &amp;amp; {}&lt;/code&gt; makes it so that the specific
strings &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt; are distinguished from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; as a whole type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way this works is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the intersection of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; (which is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string &amp;amp; {}&lt;/code&gt;), is essentially
the same as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, but it is a new type, different from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the union of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot; | &quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, which is a new
type, different from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. It contains both.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the union of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot; | &quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; expands the type to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;,
since that is the common type. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot; | &quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt;,
all inherit from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the union of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot; | &quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string &amp;amp; {}&lt;/code&gt; is
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot; | &quot;world&quot; | (string &amp;amp; {})&lt;/code&gt;, which is a new type, different from just
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;. This is because &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/code&gt; DO NOT inherit from
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string &amp;amp; {}&lt;/code&gt;, so they are distinguished from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string &amp;amp; {}&lt;/code&gt; as a whole type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this type trick, essentially we can tell the type system that we want
specific string, but also any other string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a complete view of the sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2023-02-20-typescript-magic/everything.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty funky that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string &amp;amp; {}&lt;/code&gt; are same in a way, but
different in another way. They both tell the type system that any string is
accepted. But one is inherited by every type that is a string (like
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;type Hi = &quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt;), where as the other is not inherited, so they are
distinguished from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is so cool to me! I wanted to do this and didn’t even have the words to
describe it, I didn’t know how to google it. We kind of found it accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is so so useful for types or props where you want the general type for
support (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;), but you also want the specific type for autocomplete
(&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;black100&quot;&lt;/code&gt;). It made my whole week when I figured that out and made that
color type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the final type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ColorDSValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;black100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;black80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;blue100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;red150&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// | etc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ColorOtherString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ColorDSValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ColorOtherString&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have autocomplete and typechecking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is such a useful little TypeScript trick. Thanks to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MrSltun&quot;&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; for finding this. He found it in a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29729#issuecomment-567871939&quot;&gt;TypeScript issue&lt;/a&gt;.
Then we tried it and figured out how to work with this, and how to make our type
exactly what we wanted, for the best DX we can get.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are you using the right Mongo geospatial query?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We recently got a report from one of our galleries in the Los Angeles area that
they weren’t showing up on our
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/shows/los-angeles-ca-usa&quot;&gt;Los Angeles exhibition listings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fielded the report and right away confirmed: when we asked our core API for
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/shows?near=&amp;lt;los angeles coordinates&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, sure enough this gallery partner didn’t
make the cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out they are based in Santa Monica, a separate and neighboring
municipality. They must not be within the 25km radius that we use by default for
these sorts of queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Case closed&lt;/em&gt;. Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some back and forth with our partner I decided to investigate more
thoroughly, this time using some tricks of the trade from
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandarooproy.com&quot;&gt;my other life&lt;/a&gt; outside of Artsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;casting-a-wider-net&quot;&gt;Casting a wider net&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there was something wrong with our 25km radius query, I wanted to start by
casting a wider net and visualizing the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consulted our Rails application code to find the query logic in question, and
then issued the same query directly to MongoDB. Something like the following
query (simplified for clarity):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// a $geoWithin $center query&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;coordinates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;$geoWithin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;$center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;118.24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;34.05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;111.32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the query above we are asking MongoDB to give us all events within a 25km
radius around the point 34.05°N, 118.24°W which we have designated as a central
point within Los Angeles. For our purposes in this post we can consider “events”
≈ “exhibitions” ≈ “shows.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not asking for the 25km radius directly, but rather converting it into an
equivalent amount of geographic degrees by using a conversion factor of 1° ≈
111.32 kilometers, a factor which is true at enough the equator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I modified the above query to cast a 50km net in order to see if there were some
edges cases that needed scrutiny. Taking the resulting JSON response, I fired up
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.placemark.io/&quot;&gt;Placemark&lt;/a&gt;, my favorite new tool for wrangling
geospatial data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Incidentally I recommend reading Tom Macwright’s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://macwright.com/2023/01/28/placemark.html&quot;&gt;recent reflection on creating Placemark&lt;/a&gt;
as a bootstrapped indie developer.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a visualization in Placemark showing Los Angeles area exhibitions within a 50km radius.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;All shows within a 50km radius&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ball-of-confusion&quot;&gt;Ball of confusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One nice feature of Placemark is that it lets us place geodesic circles on the
map, that is, circles that represent a constant radius around a point, as
plotted on a globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I placed a 25km radius circle on the map, something stood out immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a visualization in Placemark showing Los Angeles area exhibitions within a 50km radius, with a 25km radius superimposed.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;25km radius superimposed. &lt;a style=&quot;padding-bottom: 1px; border-bottom: solid 1px lightgray&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_of_Confusion_%28That%27s_What_the_World_Is_Today%29&quot;&gt;Ball of Confusion&lt;/a&gt;, that's what the world was that day.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partner in question is highlighted in pink — and is clearly within the 25km
radius. &lt;strong&gt;What gives?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By spot-checking a few points on the map against our current geo query I found
that edge cases near the top or bottom of the circle were likely to be evaluated
correctly, while edges cases at the left and right were being incorrectly
omitted, as our partner gallery was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fuller visualization of that finding would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a visualization in Placemark showing the results of a $geoWithin $center query&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Results of a &lt;code&gt;$geoWithin $center&lt;/code&gt; query around Los Angeles, evaluated against a grid of test points.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distinctly &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-circular circle — that rung a bell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-than-one-way-to-draw-a-circle-on-the-earth&quot;&gt;More than one way to draw a circle on the Earth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that I recalled the specific form of the geospatial query
our code was performing, and consulted the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/geoWithin/&quot;&gt;MongoDB docs for the $geoWithin query&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out that you can invoke this as a radius query in one of two ways, by
specifying
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/center/&quot;&gt;$center&lt;/a&gt;
or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/centerSphere/&quot;&gt;$centerSphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/center/#behavior&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;
for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$center&lt;/code&gt;, this query…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;calculates distances using flat (planar) geometry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pause for a moment to note that while only some maps are
&lt;a href=&quot;https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo27400568.html&quot;&gt;deceitful&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; maps are untruths. In the sense that they flatten three dimensions down to
two, and inevitably distort the world in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surface of a three-dimensional globe cannot be flattened down to a
two-dimensional plane without some stretching or tearing, any more than an
orange peel can be. The mathematical algorithms for turning those three
dimensions into two are what we know as map projections. (Ah, the good old days
when “dimensionality reduction” meant &lt;em&gt;from three to two&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do your distance calculations in such a flattened, projected coordinate
system — as the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$geoWithin $center&lt;/code&gt; query does — then you are accepting
whatever distortions are inherent to that projection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the situation we were in. We thought we were catching everything inside
the green circle, but in fact we were only catching everything inside the red
egg:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a visualization in Placemark showing the results of a $geoWithin $center query compared to the expected results&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Actual &lt;code&gt;$geoWithin $center&lt;/code&gt; results vs. expected results.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our unfortunate partner was &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; outside the egg, thus being incorrectly
omitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fixing-the-query&quot;&gt;Fixing the query&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily the solution was simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above MongoDB supports a second variant for radius queries using a
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$centerSphere&lt;/code&gt; operator instead of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$center&lt;/code&gt; that we were using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/centerSphere/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;
for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$centerSphere&lt;/code&gt;, this version…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;defines a circle for a geospatial query that uses spherical geometry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, this query effectively draws our circle on the three-dimensional
globe rather than on the stretched and distorted two-dimensional map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just need to rewrite our query as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// a $geoWithin $centerSphere query&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;coordinates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;$geoWithin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// $center: [[-118.24, 34.05], 25 / 111.32],    /* BEFORE */&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;$centerSphere&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;118.24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;34.05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;6378.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* AFTER */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a new conversion factor in play here, this time denoting that the
radius of the earth is approximately 6378.1 km. In this &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$centerSphere&lt;/code&gt; flavor
of the query we are working in unprojected
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system&quot;&gt;spherical coordinates&lt;/a&gt;,
measured in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian&quot;&gt;radians&lt;/a&gt;. Thus we need to
account for the size of the sphere that we are calculating upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can re-run
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/anandaroop/a1b794559615b2bbdea097678321c93f&quot;&gt;our test&lt;/a&gt;
with this version of the query, and now we see that the results are finally in
line with what we were expecting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a visualization in Placemark showing the results of a $geoWithin $centerSphere query&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Results of a &lt;code&gt;$geoWithin $centerSphere&lt;/code&gt; query around Los Angeles, evaluated against a grid of test points.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having updated our API to use this variant of the query, we solved the problem
and returned our partner gallery to its rightful place in our listings, as shown
by the pink highlight above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the happy ending we were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-postscript-on-map-distortion&quot;&gt;A postscript on map distortion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you’re curious to learn a little more about map distortion, let’s dig a
bit deeper into the nature of the problem that we were encountering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.placemark.io/&quot;&gt;Placemark&lt;/a&gt;’s ability to draw different
kinds of circles on the map, let’s now place a &lt;em&gt;geographic&lt;/em&gt; circle on the map
rather than a geodesic one. This one is computed in the simplest possible map
projection — a geographic projection where we simply treat the longitude as the
X coordinate and the latitude as the Y coordinate. (This projection goes by many
names, such as “geographic”, “equirectangular”, “Plate Carrée” or even
&lt;em&gt;“unprojected”&lt;/em&gt;, which is not quite accurate.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This corresponds to what you get when you use MongoDB’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$geoWithin&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$center&lt;/code&gt;
query on geospatial data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/6.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Animation showing the distortion a geographic circle encounters at various latitudes&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Animation showing the distortion a geographic circle encounters at various latitudes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we get: a moderately oblong egg at the latitude of Los Angeles;
a nice circle as we get close to the equator; and a very oblong egg as we
approach the poles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering why you should trust my claims about the egginess of &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;
two-dimensional image after I just said that all such maps are lies — good
question!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just so happens that nearly all web-based interactive maps, including
Placemark, use a variation of the Mercator projection, the one you might
remember from schoolroom maps. Mercator is a so-called
“&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map_projection&quot;&gt;conformal&lt;/a&gt;”
projection, meaning that &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; particular lie is to sacrifice area in favor of
shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shape drawn on a globe will be correctly maintained in a Mercator map, but the
scale will vary across the map: true at the equator and very incorrect towards
the poles. This is the reason for the common complaint that
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news-blog/data-visualisation-animated-map-mercater-projection-true-size-countries&quot;&gt;Mercator maps show Greenland as about the same size as Africa&lt;/a&gt;,
when in fact Africa is about 14 times larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount and nature of the distortion introduced by map projections is such an
important topic that cartographers have long relied on a clever technique for
communicating this distortion visually, known as
“&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissot%27s_indicatrix&quot;&gt;Tissot’s indicatrix&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you a sense of the kind of distortion we encountered with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$center&lt;/code&gt;
query, here is what Tissot’s indicatrix looks like for the geographic
projection. This shows essentially the inverse of the animation above — what
does a true circle plotted on the globe look like at various locations on this
map projection?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tissot's indicatrix for equirectangular projection&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine the inverse operation of this ⤴︎, drawing &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; circles on this
planar space, in order to get a sense of how distorted your query results on a
globe would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, here is Tissot’s indicatrix for the Mercator projection, demonstrating
its ability to preserve shapes at the expense of sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2023-02-10-mongo-geospatial-queries/8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tissot's indicatrix for Mercator projection&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting recent development is that the web’s reliance on Mercator is
changing, but only very slowly.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/5/17653122/google-maps-update-mercator-projection-earth-isnt-flat&quot;&gt;Google began to make this change&lt;/a&gt;
a few years ago, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapbox.com/blog/adaptive-projections&quot;&gt;Mapbox has written about their approach&lt;/a&gt;
as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this digression into the display of geospatial data has been
illuminating. There is much more to say on this topic, since geospatial is more
or less one asterisk after another. For example, we haven’t mentioned that the
Mercator projection above is incapable of depicting the north or south poles at
all! Nor have we touched on MongoDB’s various geospatial
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/geospatial-queries/#geospatial-data&quot;&gt;data formats&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/geospatial-queries/#geospatial-indexes&quot;&gt;indexes&lt;/a&gt;,
or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/near/&quot;&gt;the $near query&lt;/a&gt;
and its spherical sibling
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/nearSphere/&quot;&gt;the $nearSphere query&lt;/a&gt;,
all worthy topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we hope that understanding this crucial distinction between planar
(&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$center&lt;/code&gt;) and spherical (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$centerSphere&lt;/code&gt;) calculations will help you make the
right choice when devising your own radius queries with MongoDB or other
geospatial engines.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Parallelizing Jest and Cypress.io Tests on CircleCI</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At Artsy, exploring ways to improve the developer experience is part of our
makeup. Whether it’s implementing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/express-reloadable&quot;&gt;hot-swapping&lt;/a&gt; for Express.js or
integrating the Rust-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/force/pull/10598&quot;&gt;SWC compiler&lt;/a&gt; into our front-end build
pipeline, we’re always trying to reduce the amount of time it takes for a code
cycle to take place. CI is no exception. When a developer opens a PR, we want to
ensure they get timely feedback. Do their unit tests pass? Does the app build
correctly? And how about smoke tests? Each of these jobs are complex processes
that take time, and the more one can parallelize said tasks the less devs will
need to wait. Scaled out to a whole engineering org, minor improvements to CI
can be radical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, two things came across our radar recently that we’d like to
share: sharding via Jest, and a (free) way to parallelize Cypress.io integration
tests via CircleCI’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sharding-in-jest&quot;&gt;Sharding in Jest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What is sharding?” Good question! In short, it means “a small part of a whole”.
The database community has employed sharding techniques for decades, where a
large database is split up into smaller, more manageable chunks, usually to
improve performance at scale. The same idea can be applied to any process or
task involving a lot of data, including tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it like this. Imagine an app that has thousands of tests. One can
open up their terminal and run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yarn test&lt;/code&gt; and execute all of the tests at once
in a single process, or one can open two terminal tabs and run
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yarn test src/utils&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yarn test src/routes&lt;/code&gt;, and have both processes
allocate a pool of memory to complete each (smaller) subset of tasks. Because
each process has its own memory pool the performance characteristics are
generally better, and thus the overall time required to run our tests is reduced
/ decreased. Running each of these commands scoped to a particular folder is
easy enough, but in a CI environment this is somewhat cumbersome; we’d need to
define two new jobs and then the conditions in which they run, increasing the
scope and complexity of our configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://jestjs.io/blog/2022/04/25/jest-28#sharding-of-test-run&quot;&gt;Jest’s new sharding feature&lt;/a&gt; comes into play, which
taps nicely into most modern CI runners. Using a hypothetical app containing 100
tests, here’s a quick example of how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;yarn jest &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--shard&lt;/span&gt; 1/5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this says is: take the total number of tests (100), divide them into five
buckets (containing 20 tests each), and execute the test runner against the
first bucket (the first 20 tests). Continuing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;yarn jest &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--shard&lt;/span&gt; 2/5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now take the second bucket and execute the next 20 tests – and so on. Simple
enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking this further, we could turn this into a bash loop, including an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;
symbol to run things in parallel and automating some of the redundancy away:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;BUCKETS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;5

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;1..&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;BUCKETS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do
   &lt;/span&gt;yarn jest &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--shard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$BUCKETS&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many the above snippet should be sufficient to speed up your test suite, but
who wants to write bash loops? Thankfully, most modern CI task runners contain
the ability to split jobs into separate processes programatically and so this
kind of logic is unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to do this in Circle CI:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;parallelism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;yarn test --shard=$(expr $CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX + 1)/$CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;parallelism&lt;/code&gt; value, and drop the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jest&lt;/code&gt; command into a cool one-liner.
The variable &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX&lt;/code&gt; refers to which container index the job is
running on, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL&lt;/code&gt; points to the value of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;parallelism&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Artsy.net, we’ve been able to reduce the average time it takes to run our
unit tests from around ~10 minutes per PR to just above 2m. A 4-5x performance
improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parallelizing-cypressio-integration-tests-for-free&quot;&gt;Parallelizing Cypress.io Integration Tests (For Free)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who want robust integration test coverage, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cypress.io&quot;&gt;Cypress.io&lt;/a&gt; has
been a game-changer due to its reliability and ease of use. Here at Artsy we use
it in a number of apps, most notably
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/integrity&quot;&gt;Integrity&lt;/a&gt;. One complaint, however, is just
how &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt; it is. This is reasonable; Cypress is simulating a user browsing your
website and sometimes a user needs to do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; (such as logging in) before
they can do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;. At scale this can really slow things down and lead to
bottlenecks, especially if deploys are dependent on all of your integration
tests passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cypress.io team has recognized this bottleneck and released the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.cypress.io/guides/dashboard/introduction&quot;&gt;Cypress Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, a
paid product which includes the ability to unlock parallelized tests on your CI.
For those willing to pay for another SAAS product this will get the job done
well, but for those with leaner budgets there’s another way to accomplish this
for free, and on CircleCI it’s very easy to setup via the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://circleci.com/docs/parallelism-faster-jobs#using-the-circleci-cli-to-split-tests&quot;&gt;CircleCI CLI command &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;split&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/force/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml#L219-L235&quot;&gt;full example here&lt;/a&gt;,
but in short:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;integration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;parallelism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;TESTS=$(circleci tests glob &quot;cypress/integration&quot; | circleci tests split | paste -sd ',')&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;cypress run --spec $TESTS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;circleci tests glob&lt;/code&gt; command to gather all of our tests, and then
pipe that into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;circleci tests split&lt;/code&gt; which will divide our tests into
buckets, similar to how Jest’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--shard&lt;/code&gt; command works up above. We then assign
that to a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$TESTS&lt;/code&gt; variable and pass it into &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cypress run --spec $TESTS&lt;/code&gt;.
CircleCI sees the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;parallelism&lt;/code&gt; prop in the config and automatically divides our
tests into 5 separate containers, each running a small subset of our integration
tests in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Artsy.net, our smoke tests times have gone from around ~7m on average down to
~3m. A huge reduction for only a few lines of config!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hacking Around Safari's 7-day Cookie Limit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Amongst the many, many things that organizations have to contend with around
cookie consent laws is Apple’s very own browser, Safari. Did you know that
Safari will only retain a client-side cookie for 7 days? This is in support of
Apple’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://clearcode.cc/blog/intelligent-tracking-prevention-faq&quot;&gt;Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP)&lt;/a&gt; feature, designed to
protect a user’s privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These privacy efforts are great but, in hand with laws like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa&quot;&gt;CCPA&lt;/a&gt;, their rollout often creates a UX nightmare for users without some
extra care. Here at Artsy, we’ve landed on a way to make things slightly less
bad and want to share our approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario: Imagine that as a EU resident you visit artsy.net for the first time.
A banner appears asking you to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Accept&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Deny&lt;/code&gt; tracking cookies from our
site. You don’t like tracking cookies, so you click the “Deny” button and the
banner disappears. All good, right? Nope! You visit Artsy a week later and
again, a banner appears asking you to choose your preferences. This happens
again and again until you switch browsers and realize that what you were
experiencing was Apple’s ITP feature in action. After choosing your preferences,
the cookie we use to store them is erased after 7 days, necessitating another
interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thrashed around in this vicious cycle for months until we found a simple,
elegant solution thanks to a WebKit engineer’s prompt (during Apple’s open lab
calls at WWDC – &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/labs/&quot;&gt;which you too can schedule!&lt;/a&gt;) She mentioned that the
7-day cookie limitation only applies to &lt;em&gt;client-side cookies&lt;/em&gt; and that
&lt;strong&gt;same-domain, secure, server-side cookies&lt;/strong&gt; are not limited to these
constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got us thinking. Our third-party cookie consent management service sets a
client-side cookie, not a server-side cookie. Could we perhaps overwrite the
client-side cookie with a server-side cookie &lt;em&gt;of the same name&lt;/em&gt; and trick Safari
into persisting the user preferences beyond the 7-day limit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gave it a try and… Yes. We. Can! And this means that you can too (and it’s
also real easy to implement).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, define an API endpoint server-side:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-tsx highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/set-tracking-preferences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;trackingPreferences&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cookieConfig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;maxAge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;httpOnly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;secure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// important!&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;trackingPreferences&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Overwrite client-side cookie with cloned, secure server-side version&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;trackingPreferences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;trackingPreferences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cookieConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Tracking preferences set.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, call the endpoint from the client when your app boots or when preferences
have been set by the user:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-tsx highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cookies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;cookies-js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;trackingPreferences&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;encodeURIComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cookies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;trackingPreferences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`/set-tracking-preferences?trackingPreferences=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;trackingPreferences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;CookieConsentBanner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it. I’m not sure of the exact reason why we can overwrite cookies in
this way, but I suspect it has to do with Safari’s assumption that a server we
control will always take precedence and thus assumes things are safe. And in 7
days, when Safari would otherwise erase the cookie, it will see that it’s now
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;secure&lt;/code&gt; and ignore it, preserving the user’s preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Third Time's the Charm: Deprecating KAWS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you tell when it’s time to deprecate a system? If something mostly works OK, is it worth spending time and
effort replacing its functionality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Artsy, we realized several years ago that we needed to be able to group a bunch of artworks together. If we
wanted to have a page with all of the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/collection/lucio-fontana-ceramics&quot;&gt;ceramics by Lucio Fontana&lt;/a&gt;, or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/collection/buy-now-contemporary-prints-in-the-ifpda-fair-spring-2022&quot;&gt;contemporary prints from the IFPDA Fair Sprint 2022&lt;/a&gt;,
or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/collection/antwaun-sargents-wishlist&quot;&gt;gift guide curated by Antwaun Sargent&lt;/a&gt;, we needed
to have a way to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to call these things “collections,” a reasonable name for a collection of artworks. In order to create
them, we developed a service called KAWS, named after the artist (whose works we wanted to put in several of these
collections).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, 4 years later, we’ve taken down the service and folded its functionality into Artsy’s main database and API,
Gravity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about why and what we learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-little-context&quot;&gt;A little context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KAWS has a somewhat unusual design. It’s a server, a Node.js app with its own Mongo database, and it serves up a
GraphQL API. It also relies on &lt;a href=&quot;https://typeorm.io/#/&quot;&gt;TypeORM&lt;/a&gt; to map TypeScript models to database records and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://typegraphql.com&quot;&gt;TypeGraphQL&lt;/a&gt; to keep TS and GraphQL types in sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes it a bit different from most services Artsy maintains. Most of our APIs are Ruby on Rails apps, and we
don’t have any other uses of TypeORM and TypeGraphQL. When it was created, it was a cool experiment with a possible
direction for future APIs - one we decided not to pursue for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KAWS doesn’t store any artworks - or even any artwork IDs. Instead, it just stores a “query”, a set of
Elasticsearch criteria. This could be a list of artist IDs or gene IDs, a tag ID, a keyword, or any combination of
those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, a KAWS artwork collection could be defined in human-readable terms as something like
“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/collection/bridget-riley-black-and-white&quot;&gt;artworks with the ‘Black and White’ gene by the artist Bridget Riley&lt;/a&gt;”
or
“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/collection/auguste-rodin-bronze-sculpture&quot;&gt;artworks by Auguste Rodin with the keyword ‘bronze’ and the gene ‘Sculpture’&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach results in a somewhat odd flow for resolving collection requests. Let’s say a user requests the page
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/collection/kaws-toys&quot;&gt;KAWS: Toys&lt;/a&gt;. Our frontend, Force, sends a request to Metaphysics, our
GraphQL API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metaphysics knows to route that request to KAWS - it asks KAWS “hey, what’s the Elasticsearch query for the
collection with slug &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kaws-toys&lt;/code&gt;? Also, give me the title, the category, the header image, the description text,
and [any other pieces of metadata about the collection itself].” But it can’t ask KAWS for the artworks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, it receives the query from KAWS and then turns around and sends another request to Gravity, which stores
all of our artworks and indexes them in Elasticsearch so that we can filter them. “Hey Gravity, I got this query
from KAWS (the service, not the artist): &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{ artists: 'KAWS', genes: 'Sculpture' }&lt;/code&gt;. Can you return me all of the
artworks that match that query?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gravity takes those parameters and passes them to its Elasticsearch cluster, fetching all artworks that match the
criteria (and sorting/filtering them according to what the user has selected on the page).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gravity returns those artworks to Metaphysics, which then packages them up with all of the collection metadata it
received from KAWS and returns to the client that requested it. Whew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a diagram showing what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram depicting how requests for collections get resolved&quot; src=&quot;/images/2022-05-06-deprecating-kaws/kaws-diagram.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-we-decide-to-deprecate-it&quot;&gt;Why did we decide to deprecate it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;idiosyncratic-stack&quot;&gt;Idiosyncratic stack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, KAWS is an unusual app by Artsy standards. It’s neither a database-backed Rails/Ruby app, nor
an API-consuming JavaScript/Node app. It was missing the typical Rails niceties (a dev console, background jobs,
rake tasks, etc.), and inclusion of elements like TypeORM and TypeGraphQL that don’t exist in our other apps meant
there was a bit of a learning curve for working with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s not terrible to have some variety in our systems, it does make them harder to work in and keep
up-to-date. And that also resulted in a high…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lottery-factor&quot;&gt;Lottery factor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still people at Artsy who’ve worked in KAWS, but the top 4 contributors have moved on to other companies.
That meant that any projects involving KAWS required extra effort to familiarize devs with the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lack-of-relationship-between-collections-and-artworks&quot;&gt;Lack of relationship between collections and artworks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any KAWS-backed artwork grid (e.g. any &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/collection/:slug&lt;/code&gt; page) is the ephemeral result of a canned search query.
This has some advantages: collections stay evergreen &amp;amp; current, so long as artworks with appropriate metadata
continue to land on the platform. But it also has some downsides: there is no modeled relationship between a
collection and its artworks, so given an artwork, you &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; tell what collections it’s in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extra-hops-on-each-request&quot;&gt;Extra hops on each request&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/collection/:slug&lt;/code&gt; request has to go to → MP → Kaws→ MP → Gravity → ES. The diagram above illustrates this
flow. And it’s worth noting that KAWS really doesn’t store that much. It’s a whole service that only stores a
single data type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lack-of-admin-ui&quot;&gt;Lack of admin UI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collections in KAWS were first created via a CSV import, then eventually a Google Sheets-driven workflow was added.
To create or update a collection, an admin creates/modifies a row in the spreadsheet, then goes to our Jenkins UI
and kicks off an “update collections” job, which causes KAWS to pull the new data from the Google Sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty rough workflow, and it means it’s very easy to accidentally modify or delete information from a
collection (e.g. overwriting the text in the wrong cell).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-we-go-about-planning-it&quot;&gt;How did we go about planning it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This actually wasn’t the first time we attempted to deprecate KAWS. It became something of a running joke: every
October for 3 years running (2019, 2020, 2021), someone would say “hey we should probably deprecate this thing” and
write a tech plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;illustration&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022-05-06-deprecating-kaws/Screen Shot 2022-05-06 at 12.49.55 PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a
comment on a previous tech plan. Text says 'I do like how this is becoming an Artsy autumnal tradition. Pumpkin
Spice Kaws Deprecation 😆. That alone tells us something.'&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;At least we're self-aware&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, there were three key differences that allowed us to get it done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a business need to do it. We want to work on improving collections, bringing new features to them and
making it easier for our admins to manage and use collections for important marketing campaigns. We took a look
at collections as they existed and said “deprecating KAWS and moving its functionality into Gravity is a
prerequisite for these projects.” We could have eventually completed them, but it would have been slower and
more difficult - we were confident that investing time into this refactor now would save a lot of time and
headaches later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We kept the plan very tightly scoped, focusing only on “maintain existing functionality and move it to Gravity.”
Previous iterations of the tech plan had proposed broader changes, such as rethinking collections modeling
entirely or breaking with our existing GraphQL schema. Any changes to fields currently being consumed by our
frontend clients significantly increases scope, especially since our GraphQL schema is “baked in” to our app.
That means that if we removed fields the app was currently relying on, some users who never upgrade their apps
would see that functionality break.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, the authors of those tech plans weren’t wrong to propose rethinking and improving how collections
are modeled and served! We may very well end up implementing some of their ideas and suggestions. The learning
this time around was mostly “we’re never going to get this done unless we really rein in the scope.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Our goal was 100% compatibility: all of the currently-used fields would still be available and could be
successfully resolved by Gravity instead of KAWS. Even if we changed the type of those fields or updated how
they were resolved, they still needed to exist. We did end up getting rid of lots of fields that were not being
used by frontend clients (which meant a lot of spelunking through our code and trying to find out if fields like
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;showOnEditorial&lt;/code&gt; were still being used), so the schema is still significantly simpler and cleaner than it was.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roop laid a really nice foundation by writing up a thorough document about what KAWS is, how it works, and the
steps we might need to take in order to deprecate it. Much of this blog post comes almost verbatim from that
document! It’s a testament to the power that well-organized documentation can have: being able to see and
understand the problem gave us confidence to tackle it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the diagram he created that sketches out how we might go about deprecating KAWS:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2022-05-06-deprecating-kaws/kaws-tasks.png&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram with many different steps connected by arrows indicating which updates need to be made in what order to allow us to deprecate KAWS.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-we-learn&quot;&gt;What did we learn?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-easy-for-scope-to-expand-without-you-noticing&quot;&gt;It’s easy for scope to expand without you noticing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that our goal was JUST moving KAWS functionality to Gravity, and that we wanted to avoid adding new
functionality to keep the project focused. We mostly did that - but we &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get off track in one important way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve discussed how KAWS doesn’t include direct relationships between artworks and collections. As we worked on
moving collections to Gravity, we had a baked-in assumption that there would be a join model between &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Artwork&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MarketingCollection&lt;/code&gt; (the name of the model in Gravity). This was largely informed by the approach we took to
moving &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArtistSeries&lt;/code&gt; from KAWS to Gravity, a project we previously completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that case, we created an explicit link between the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArtistSeries&lt;/code&gt; model and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Artwork&lt;/code&gt; model, and we updated
those relationships with a daily recurring job. We would essentially run the query defined by the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArtistSeries&lt;/code&gt;,
see if there were any new artworks that matched, and if so, add them to the Series in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we tried this same approach for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MarketingCollections&lt;/code&gt;, we noticed there was a problem: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArtistSeries&lt;/code&gt; cap out
at a few hundred works, but &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MarketingCollections&lt;/code&gt; could be as many as &lt;em&gt;several hundred thousand&lt;/em&gt; for collections
like “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/collection/contemporary&quot;&gt;Contemporary&lt;/a&gt;” that are based on very general criteria. The
jobs to associate artworks with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MarketingCollections&lt;/code&gt; were taking so long that they ate up all of our Sidekiq
resources and prevented other jobs from being executed in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we took a step back and looked at the problem, we realized that we were getting ahead of ourselves. Yes, we
will likely want to directly associate artworks with collections - but there actually wasn’t a clear business
reason for doing so. We were just doing it because we were “pretty sure we might need it at some point.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to unblock the project, we removed the join models and instead kept a similar approach to what KAWS used
initially: fetching artworks at request time using the Elasticsearch query stored on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MarketingCollection&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;theres-a-reason-we-dont-name-our-projects-after-artists&quot;&gt;There’s a reason we don’t name our projects after artists!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/05/10/why-projects-need-codenames/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about how we name our
projects written by our Senior Director of Engineering, Joey:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Choose a code name scheme that isn’t directly related to your technology or business. A flower business using
flower names is cute, but breaks down when you want to build a feature that &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; is about tulips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of our systems at Artsy are named after scientific concepts. Force, Eigen, Fresnel. This can seem confusing at
first, but it means there are not many opportunities for mistaking a system with its data. With a project like this
one named after an artist, discussions get confusing quickly! “Yeah, we need to make sure we’re fetching all of the
artworks from KAWS. Sorry, not the artworks &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; KAWS, I actually meant the Warhol collection. But KAWS is the
service. Right. Anyway…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feature-flagging-a-graphql-service-with-a-schema-is-hard&quot;&gt;Feature flagging a GraphQL service with a schema is hard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plan for launching this change was pretty simple: introduce a new environment variable to Metaphysics and
toggle it when we wanted to QA or launch. Toggling the variable to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and restarting Metaphysics’ Kubernetes
pods would result in a few updates to the schema (removal of all of the unused types that we got rid of) and would
cause requests for collections to be routed to Gravity instead of KAWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We figured that we would flip this variable on staging, QA, resolve any issues, and release. We wouldn’t need to
flip it off unless we had broken something big by accident; we wouldn’t be in danger of shipping these changes to
production since they would exist only in our staging environment and were not checked in to version control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we had forgotten something crucial: Metaphysics has a post-merge step in CI that creates PRs with any
schema updates in client services like Force and Eigen, and the schema it ships to those services is &lt;em&gt;pulled
directly from staging Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not the version of the schema that’s stored in GitHub (which we had
carefully avoided changing by not flipping the feature flag), it’s the schema that exists in the staging
environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Force (for example) received an updated &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MarketingCollection&lt;/code&gt; type in its schema, which didn’t
exist (and wouldn’t exist until we finished QA and decided to launch) in production Metaphysics schema. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also meant we accidentally blocked deploys for a while. Services like Force have a check before they can be
deployed to production: “does my copy of Metaphysics’ schema have changes that are not present in production
Metaphysics? If so, that probably means deploying me would break something, so go deploy Metaphysics first.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the flag was still set to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; on production, the schema updates would never move past staging. We
eventually figured out the problem and flipped the flag to “off”, re-ran the “update client schemas” job, and
deployed Force &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the updated schema. But it made for a pretty confusing few hours, and it could have been
bad if we needed to ship an urgent bugfix. Lesson learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up creating a Force review app that pointed at a Metaphysics review app with the flag set to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; to
avoid causing more issues. This is definitely what we would do next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, we’re feeling pretty happy about how this project went. We hit a few snags along the way, but we launched
the change earlier this week and haven’t seen any noticeable bugs or problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there’s still an important question: was it worth it? What did we gain by completing this refactor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer will mostly depend on what happens next. We’re meeting with stakeholders next week to talk about what
kind of features we can add or modifications we might want to make. But for now, we’re excited to have one less
application to maintain and to have made it easier for future Artsy engineers to understand and iterate on our
collections infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stepping Out Of The Knowledge Zone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I am writing my first blog post for Artsy, here is a short introduction on who I am: My name is Kaja and I am an
engineer in our Berlin entity. As a Ruby-born programmer I am calling myself a backend engineer, but that also may
change and is more about emotional identification and less about what I actually do (as you will see in this blog
post). My background is not in engineering at all. In university I graduated in philosophy and historical
linguistics, both the most impractical but most beautifully theoretical subjects I can think of. I really love
being in the world of ideas and thought experiments that challenge the current status of what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, as opposed to
what is &lt;em&gt;thinkable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Artsy I am currently working in the PX (Partner Experience) Team and since I joined 1 year ago, most of my time
in the PX team has been dedicated to the implementation of the Artsy Shipping feature. In the backend I helped
tying the ties between the external ARTA-API (a white glove shipping company) and our own service that is managing
the shipping and order statuses of the artworks that are ordered online. In the front end I implemented some forms
for that feature and some so called hooks. I felt like a fish in the water with these tasks, because the company
that I had worked at before was a shipping company and I did the same thing from the other side of the API
relationship. In the same language (Ruby on Rails).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is another fact about me that is a premises for what comes next: I enjoy to be a learner of new things much
more than being an expert about things that I already know. Of course being an expert is also flattering the ego,
but after a while it can feel repetitive and make your soul feel old and tired. While the experience of being new
to something and not an expert at all can give you a rejuvenating prickle. On the other side it can be scary to
admit not knowing something and also the ego will feel small and hurt. But I learned that overcoming the hurt ego
is my way to happiness in life and I am practicing every day to let go of the idea of me being the admirable expert
and commit to the philosophical open mind of the “The only thing I know, is that I don’t know.”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the search of something new that I don’t know I stretched out my feelers* and wanted to continue my learnings
in Elixir. At my previous job I had done quite some work in that new language and still felt non-experty enough in
it to feel the prickle of learning it. It turned out to be a bit difficult since there were not many people around
me able to pair and guide me through some problems and the actual work to be done there did not appear to have
enough priority to be taking so much of my work time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I personally care a lot about is the general health of the code base and that the whole machine of a
distributed system is well oiled and working in a way that makes it easy to contribute to. This is why I also
really care about updating dependencies and feel personally in charge of doing that without anyone giving me this
role. That care and my first rotation at Artsy has made me cross the paths with the velocity team several times. I
understood that the care for the health of the code base is a shared emotion with the velocity team members and I
felt heard when they picked up this urgent topic in a platform practice (an open somewhat informal meeting for all
the devops/infrastructure things). My curiosity for the velocity team grew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But did I reach out to the velocity team to ask for some collaboration on the dependency updates? No. You have the
privilege of having a female perspective here in the blog post and I can give you some insights on the barriers for
me as a woman in tech. While the PX team is well equipped with women engineers, the velocity team only consists of
men. This plus the aura of tech-geniuses that usually surrounds the people who do devops from the perspective of an
engineer made me feel nervous and shy to reach out to the velocity team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that happened was that during some of these beloved dependency updates I had to change the docker
file of the project, because I needed a newer ruby image. The ruby image we used was a specific artsy ruby image
and we did not have one for the ruby version that I needed, so here I had to go and change the whole docker file
set up. I did not know much about docker and what all these funny &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RUN&lt;/code&gt; commands actually did and just tried and
guessed and broke stuff as I went along and at some point got stuck. So naturally I reached out to our dev-help
channel and was quickly having the help of Andre, our velocity team member in the German time zone. He paired with
me and explained the docker commands on the go and made everything seem so simple and straight forward, while also
being super nice and approachable talking about his cat and his favorite Brazilian food, that I had to question my
own prejudice about the velocity team members and come to the conclusion that they might all be men and super good
at what they did, but that at least one of them was really good at demystifying stuff and helping me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new learnings about docker lit a fire in me: I wanted to learn more of this mysterious world of infrastructure.
After letting the thoughts and feelings simmer for another week or so, I had a 1:1 with my manager Christian. He
has some magical question asking powers that truly trigger introspection and I ended up hearing myself say to him:
“I wish I could do something like an internship in the velocity team!”. Here it was. The actual wish had formed
into something that is actionable and as I learned totally possible. My Manager did some magic managing and &lt;em&gt;piff
paff&lt;/em&gt; here I was starting my 2 sprint (4 weeks) rotation in the velocity team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I was still a bit scared and nervous. Would I be able to contribute anything or would I just be an
annoyance to the team? Would I make a fool of myself and be branded as a stereotypical woman who doesn’t know
anything about tech (this is coming from many years of being perceived as a person without any tech skills). I
latched myself onto the thought, that Andre would be the person that I could talk to and that I knew he was not
going to bite my head off. I also realized in the organizing process that there was Matt Jones, another velocity
team member, who was reaching out to me and being super open and kind and having great communication skills and it
made me feel less scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first week came up and I found myself in meetings with the velocity team mostly listening at the beginning as I
was lacking some context in the conversations, but not feeling super weird as I saw that there was nothing of the
expected mysterious witch craft happening but a very straight forward Kanban board where the only unknowns where
some names of tools that I had not used before. I was also glad to see some of the faces in the meetings showing
signs of human struggle like tiredness, a very relatable thing. During my first week I didn’t really know what to
do as some of the tasks suddenly got blocked or changed or appeared to be already solved and the only thing that
kept popping up as a suggestion was to do some work on integrity, our little QA robot that automatically clicks
through the staging interfaces and checks if it behaves as expected. The general reasoning of people in the team
was “I don’t really know javascript and this cypress stuff, so it would be cool if you can take over some of the
integrity tasks”. I was still too shy to loudly admit that I myself was also not knowing anything about JS or
cypress. I felt that as a web developer coming to the velocity team they would think, but is there anything that
she knows if she doesn’t know docker nor JS??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Jones asked me for feedback on my first week as he wanted to make sure that this was a useful learning
experience for me and I told him openly that I felt a bit confused on what my tasks were and that I also didn’t
know how to fix these tests in integrity and that the only other task that was assigned to me was seeming like a
dead end to me. That other task was to implement a new user role into something that is called the &lt;em&gt;old admin&lt;/em&gt;!
Somehow this made my neck hair stand up. Implementing a new feature into a half way sunset service? I looked into
the code to see if this would be simple and straight forward and saw myself confronted with somewhat outdated
coffeescript and felt a cold shudder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second week began and as Matt had made me join some meetings on discussing how and if we should set up an
Artsy.net local docker container for the development and what other services than force (our main service for
Artsy.net) would be useful to the engineers that usually worked on force. It was an interesting learning experience
especially because Elena, the engineering Manager on the velocity and data platform teams, was asking some really
good critical questions that made me realize there was more to it than just a simple docker run for a single
project. She mentioned problems with node and the usability of the development environment, talked about previous
experiences with such aims and how it was not working as smoothly as imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second week in the velocity team also brought along some team building time. I joined a coffee call and it was
super interesting to finally also feel like I was getting to know the other mysterious team members of velocity. We
talked about our international backgrounds and it was great to hear so many stories about where people had come
from and what languages they had grown up with. This finally was melting my heart for the team and I lost my last
little bit of fear and shyness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I then started to look at integrity and list some of the tests in it that were flakey Joey, our director of
engineering, was helping me out leaving meaningful hints and comments on my notes. This plus the recent successful
coffee call with the team encouraged me to my next very risky step: In a meeting called “velocity mob session” I
proposed to the team members to mob together on some problem of integrity actually not being able to run certain
tests from two instances in the same time. It felt risky and scary driving a mob session in a repository that I
wasn’t familiar with, reproducing a problem that I wasn’t fully understanding and trying to solve it in a
language/framework that I was not an expert in. But the risk was totally worth it. It turned out to be a super
interesting and fun and collaborative mob session and we actually figured stuff out together with the whole team.
Nothing feels better than having a whole team figuring something out together. It really bonds to see stuff
happening as a shared experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third week started and in a standup I admitted that I had not been following up on implementing a new role into
our &lt;em&gt;old-admin&lt;/em&gt; because I felt uneasy to add something new to a project that was stuck in a weird mid-deprecation
state. The team reacted quickly with a super good idea: Instead of adding something to the &lt;em&gt;old-admin&lt;/em&gt; I should set
up something that was going to be the new-admin in our environment so that people could contribute to it on the
upcoming hackathon. I was thrilled! Never have I witnessed the birth of a new project at Artsy and now I was
supposed to set the whole thing up and go through each step of putting it out there? Awesome! Also I had absolutely
no idea what that meant. Did I need to do some dangerous mystic exploration into the far away field of our system
being set up in kubernetes or something? I wasn’t sure. All I had in mind were these complex huge graphs of our
system and how all the services were connected. How could I add another service into this huge spider web?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first helpful thing was a little check list that Joey gave me of things that had to be done. Breaking the task
down into smaller task definitely already demystified the whole thing a bit. It looked something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;get typical local development working&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;get &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hokusai dev start&lt;/code&gt; working (i.e., local development on docker)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create staging deployment(s) and get them working&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CircleCI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create production deployment(s) and get them working&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set up the project in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/horizon&quot;&gt;Horizon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I knew that Roop was the point person for this project and had started setting up the github repo so I started
to set up the project locally myself and then went to reach out to him for my questions that had come up. This is
how I had my first ever pairing session with Roop and it was so much fun. After having the project working for me
locally I was informed that Devon had already put a tutorial video out there on how to set up a new project with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/hokusai&quot;&gt;hokusai&lt;/a&gt; in the artsy system. I watched the video and followed the steps along
and when I got stuck reached out to Devon directly and there I was having another interesting and fun pairing
session on setting up a new project with hokusai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see each step demystified this task further and further so that in the end after another bunch of fun
pairing sessions with Jian and Joey I got the new admin deployed and ready just in time for my week four of the
rotation: The hackathon week! During that week I was continuing my integrity work, pairing with different people
from different product teams on the flakey cypress tests and in the same time doing my own personal favorite
hackathon project: Updating dependencies in our code base. I will basically use every excuse I get to update our
dependencies, because they just need that love and I believe that we can get the code base to a point where it is
not so painful anymore to keep stuff up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the end of the fourth week came up, so did my end of the rotation with the velocity team and I was sad to leave.
I asked the team members to give me some feedback and was hoping to be able to work on the new admin and on
integrity and on the Artsy local docker stuff more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following weeks some awesome feedback came in and I was glad to see that I was not the only one really enjoying
all the nice pairing and good times on the velocity team. As much as I like the PX team and also missed them, I
secretly hoped that some day in the future I could switch over to velocity in the long term. I knew now that I
would be learning so much and that none of this was scary anymore. And then it came: An email from Elena saying
that the velocity team was internally searching for a new member! Maybe the timing was just right, maybe the
universe just loves me so much… I don’t know, but my wishes became true and I am now moving over to velocity. I
guess sometimes it is really worth leaning into the scary unknowns and going all the way there to see if it is
really so scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*“Die Fühler ausstrecken” = German &lt;em&gt;to stretch out your feelers&lt;/em&gt; stands for “to prudently try and see something
that you don’t know” as a snail would do to find her way forward very slowly and retreat from something unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Context to Simplify a VERY Large React Form</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar, Artsy is a fine art marketplace. Knowing that, it follows logically to say that the form via
which our partners list artworks for sale is an integral part of Artsy’s core systems. This form, known only as
“The Artwork Form,” is whispered about in the halls of Arty’s New York headquarters. It is legendary. It is a
colossus. It is old enough not only to predate React v16.8 hooks and context APIs, but Artsy’s use of React
entirely. The first version of the Artwork Form was built in 2014 using ruby and haml, and began its refactoring
into JS/JQuery/React a full 2 years later, after having expanded considerably from the original implementation.
That process (at least what we’ve gleaned from our git excavation) was incremental, experimental, and passed
through many hands before it landed in the lap of the current Partner Experience (PX) team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PX has since been tasked with the maintenance of this unwieldy kaiju, spending endless amounts of time on seemingly
insignificant changes to behavior or UI, all while watching its performance degrade. Many of the people reading
this are already familiar with the story we’re telling. Many have worked in their very own version of the tale, and
borne witness to the fact that legacy code of this scale becomes a living, breathing entity. The developers that
tend these beasts learn their patterns and idiosyncrasies, their little moans and groans, and for the sake of
expediency work within those constraints to accomplish their tasks. But when is enough, enough? When does the
developer time expended working within the constraints of an obsolete design begin to outweigh the time it would
take to simply &lt;em&gt;fix&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;the code&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s be honest: there is no single right answer to this question. When working in software development we
have to deal with certain realities: user experience vs. developer experience, lead time to the next release,
buy-in from stakeholders, etc. These factors may weigh more or less depending on the shop and the product. At Artsy
we’re very lucky, in that our engineering department is given the time to attend to our tech debt and to be
deliberate about when and how we go about this. In the case of the Artwork Form, there were several issues that had
become too glaring to ignore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The data coming in, and subsequently being passed to individual components, was being completely obscured by the
amount of prop drilling and spreading that existed within the composed form.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The prolific use of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; when typing data was disabling typescript and consequently removing its usefulness
while still imposing all of its burdens.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The components within the form were tightly coupled, the number and specificity of props needed for each
disallowing reuse in other parts of the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of us on the PX team decided to take matters into our own hands and address some of these key problems with
the Artwork Form. We came up with a plan to incrementally convert the form to use values from the Formik context,
use these values wherever possible to reduce prop-drilling, add much more complete types to the components to get
rid of all the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;’s, and update some of our testing strategies as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps we took to do this conversion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a hook that allows us to use the Formik context throughout the form&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The hook wraps &lt;a href=&quot;https://formik.org/docs/api/useFormikContext&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;useFormikContext&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to allow all of our components
inside of Formik to access the values from Formik context. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;useArtworkForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;FormikContextType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ArtworkValues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;formikContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;useFormikContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ArtworkValues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;formikContext&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArtworkValues&lt;/code&gt; as the generic type so that when we are accessing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; anywhere inside the component
tree, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; can be type-checked.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convert all of the components in the form to functional components and to TypeScript. (Because the form is
several years old, there were still many class components and many components that were not yet using
TypeScript.) This step could be done in parallel with Step 1. One note here is that when converting files from
JavaScript to TypeScript, we did not explicitly type the props in an interface. Once we can take advantage of
our &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;useArtworkForm&lt;/code&gt; hook, we will reduce the amount of props needed in each component, so we will hold off on
typing the props until step 3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bulk of the work was making use of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;useArtworkForm&lt;/code&gt; hook in the Artwork Form components. Starting with
the lowest leaves of the component tree and moving up, we removed the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; from the component definition and
destructured any values we needed in the component from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;useArtworkForm&lt;/code&gt; hook. Once we used everything we
could from the context, we added back in any additional props that we would still need to have passed down from
the parent. In many cases, this was no props at all—a particularly satisfying case. If the component still
needed props passed down, we explicitly typed the props at the top of each component in an interface because we
now knew exactly which props we would need inside of the component. Another key step here was going into the
parent component and getting rid of any prop spreading (this: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;...props&lt;/code&gt;) and instead explicitly passing down
exactly the props needed in the component (if there were any).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A note on tests: Whenever we took advantage of the Formik context in a component, we were breaking that
component’s tests, because the wrappers we were using in the tests did not have access to the Formik context
and were being passed props that the component was no longer looking at. We created a helper test wrapper
that we could use in all of our Artwork Form tests to wrap the test’s specific wrapper inside of a
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Formik/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component and provide the specific &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; to use as the initial values for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Formik&lt;/code&gt;. Many of
our test cases involve passing different &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; into the component, which we originally did via props but
now will do via the Formik context through the wrapper. Here’s what the wrapper looks like:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-tsx highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TestFormikWrapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;FC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TestFormikWrapperProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Formik&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;initialValues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;onSubmit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;jest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Formik&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Here is an example of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TestFormikWrapper&lt;/code&gt; used in a test:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-tsx highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;TestComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;displays values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;wrapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TestFormikWrapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Andy Warhol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TestComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TestFormikWrapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;wrapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;#name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toInclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Andy Warhol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once we completed the conversion all the way up the tree to the root component, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArtworkForm&lt;/code&gt;, we typed that
component as strictly as possible and made sure to get rid of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;’s. There were quite a few when we started
the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, where did we end up? Now all of the components in the Artwork Form are making use of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;useArtworkForm&lt;/code&gt; hook
if they were previously accessing any of the values from the Formik context from props. We have much less prop
drilling between components and instead explicitly pass down the props needed from parent to child. It’s now much
more clear for developers what data is passing between the components and what data is actually being used in the
child. All of the components are also explicitly typed so we know exactly which props, if any, need to be passed
down from the parent. If any of these props are removed, TypeScript helps us by failing loudly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main pain points of the Artwork Form is that it’s very difficult for new developers (whether new to
Artsy or new to the Partner Experience team) to contribute and make changes to the form without breaking something
or spending extra time figuring out how data is passed within the form. Hopefully, this change will make it easier
for developers to understand the Artwork From.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did the Artwork Form get so complicated? Well, as we shared, the Artwork Form is the key to achieving one of
the PX team’s core goals: surfacing the most accurate and rich information about artworks to collectors. We have to
allow partners to add more and increasingly specific pieces of metadata to artworks. The form has been growing and
for better or worse, will need to keep growing. Even though we expect to grow the form to meet metadata needs, we
do not put too much focus on the UX/UI of the Artwork Form in order to prioritize our collector-facing apps. (The
Artwork Form is only used by a relatively small subset of users, mostly gallery partners.) Hopefully, this refactor
will allow us to expand the form more seamlessly and will make it easier to navigate as it grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This refactor is still in its early days. The next steps for making the form easier to use (for both developers and
our end users) will require larger changes. When we think about further progress on revamping the Artwork Form, our
team is considering breaking the form up into smaller forms. Imagine, we are rendering several different top-level
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Formik&lt;/code&gt; components that include discrete sections of the form, instead of just one giant &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Formik&lt;/code&gt; tree as we have
now. We would then combine these “mini forms” together, making better use of React’s core principle of composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking up the form would be a big change for the developer experience (but hopefully made easier by this
refactor). It could also involve big changes to the UI. The Artwork Form is not just hard to navigate for
developers. It’s hard for users too. Over the next couple of months, our Product Manager will be working with one
of Artsy’s user researchers to conduct user testing on the form. Feedback from galleries will help determine where
we next take this project. We’re excited to have buy-in from our product team to work on a project that will
elevate the user experience while allowing us to use that opportunity to improve the developer experience as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Year in Review: 2021</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ufff, 2021 was a tough year. It was the second year of the Covid-19 pandemic. We tried our best to support each
other through these challenging times and in that spirit, we feel like it’s important not to lose sight of our
accomplishments. As we say goodbye to 2021 and hello to 2022, here are some Artsy Engineering wins from this past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did you ship in 2021? We would love to hear about it and celebrate with you!&lt;/p&gt;
