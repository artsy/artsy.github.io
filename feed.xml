        <title>Danger</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Danger came out of two needs. One from the needs of a growing dev team working together full-time, and the other from the needs of a completely asymmetric large Open Source project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A work environment dev team is a complex place. You naturally grow, and to grow safely you add process. Process is a mixed bag, it&#39;s a net benefit at the trade-off of individual&#39;s time vs team cohesion. You want to grow your team guided by smart applications of process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, working on a large open source project, it&#39;s easy to feel overwhelmed at the amount of work that needs to get done on a daily basis. The growth of your OSS team probably doesn&#39;t tie to the amount of work that needs to be done. Especially if you&#39;re like me, and you don&#39;t want to be maintaining OSS as a 2nd full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you do? Well in a work environment you don&#39;t really have a choice, as a team you hold each other to the rules that you set. In OSS, you sacrifice your spare time or you can find time at work, you could stop or you could burn out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the environment in which the idea of Danger was incubated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today mark version 1.0 of the second version of Danger. I&#39;m going to cover what they are, how they continue to grow and what I see their trajectory as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Why.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danger came from a need to customise the GitHub workflow for pull requests. In a work context, we wanted to add process like CHANGELOGs and be more thorough about testing. In Open Source, we needed to stop asking the same things to drive-by contributors. Their patches are valuable for sure, but asking for the same changes each time gets tiring. We want to work at a higher level of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases you want a way to give instant feedback for things that are &quot;Unit Tests have failed&quot; or &quot;Code could not compile&quot;. However, it&#39;s hard to give feedback that says &quot;You have not added a CHANGELOG entry in the right format.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically CI would only provide a binary: true or false response to the changes for review. We want a more shades of grey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;What.does.Danger.do.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does Danger do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danger acts as a way of creating unit tests at code review level. It gives you the ability to write tests that say: &quot;has this file changed?&quot;, &quot;does the contents of new files include this string?&quot;, &quot;does the build log include a warning we know is bad news?&quot; then the results of those tests are moved back into the place you&#39;re talking about the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, you need to be able to create your own rules. Every team has different dynamics, and while it makes sense to offer a set of a set of standard rules that can work across a lot of projects - I&#39;m pretty sure that the needs of the Artsy engineering team is different from the needs of your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danger runs your code, and provides a set of easy to use APIs for you to build these useful culture rules. You write your rules in code, we call these files Dangerfiles. Similar to how a testing framework would give a set of expectations. The general gist is Danger provides access to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes from Git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes from GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interacting with Danger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By making per-project rules with these APIs, you can cover most rote tasks involved in code review. To make it easy for anyone to run Danger on every pull request, Danger was made to run during continuous integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;OK..so..2.versions.of.Danger..&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;OK, so &quot;2 versions of Danger&quot;?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first implemented Danger in Ruby. Ruby is a great language for building terminal apps, in the iOS community it&#39;s the language in which the largest OSS projects are built in. So, as someone used to building apps in that space, it wasn&#39;t really a debate what language to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ruby build of Danger is now at 5.x with almost 100 releases, it&#39;s a solid exploration into code review automation. Ultimately though, I started to feel three main pain-points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Artsy, we moved our mobile team to React Native, and other teams were also consolidating on JavaScript everywhere. It felt weird using a Ruby inside a strictly JS only context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to re-create the environment of a PR was tricky from inside the CI. For example most providers are good at about saving on space and bandwidth during a run, and Danger often has to ruin that in order to replicate the PR locally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to explore server-side Dangerfiles. I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable hosting a server that allows anyone to run their own Ruby code. Ruby isn&#39;t built with sandboxing in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I explored the idea of having JavaScript based Dangerfiles inside the Ruby version of Danger. I did this by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danger/danger/pull/422&quot;&gt;bridging Danger&#39;s Ruby objects into a JavaScript context&lt;/a&gt; and allowing bi-directional communication between the two. This handled some of the immediate needs, but proved inadequate when working with JavaScript&#39;s simple system library and it ignored all other JavaScript tooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enough time, I came to the conclusion that realistically, to use JavaScript properly, you need node modules and npm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So 10 months ago I decided it was worth starting from scratch and re-created Danger in JavaScript. I had time to consider what I would do differently, and this time I added one key additional restraints on the system: Data can only come from an API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This constraint negates one of the key problems with running running a Dangerfile on a server - having to have a copy of the code and the PR&#39;s environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, JavaScript has a much simpler model for evaluating, importing and exporting code and so whitelisting modules and functions can be feasible for a hosted version of Danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src =&quot;/images/danger/danger.png&quot; style=&quot;width:50%&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;L1.0.is.my.middle.name&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;1.0 is my middle name&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any software project used in production should probably be 1.0, but in addition to production use a library needs documentation to be 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling Danger production ready means doing the entire &lt;a href=&quot;http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/07/03/handling-big-projects/&quot;&gt;Defensive OSS&lt;/a&gt; process: Documentation, Guides, API Reference, Website and Branding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once each version of Danger had started to mature to a point that the user-facing aspect stopped changing I started focusing on the documentation engine and website. In both cases, a considerable amount of documentation is generated from the source code of Danger. I&#39;m a big fan of keeping that inside the source code and building documentation sites which import it directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;So.what.can.I.do.with.Danger.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So what can I do with Danger?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one way this is a bit like asking, so what can I test with unit tests? Anything, within the scope of: the PR, build artifacts and introspecting the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll cover a quick API overview, then talk about how you can work with these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Git&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Git&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What files have been added, removed or changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes specific to a file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking into Commits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploring the Diff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;GitHub...GitLab...BitBucket&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to the PR&#39;s JSON representation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistent access for PR body, title, author across all platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Util functions for linking to files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Danger&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Danger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handle running other Dangerfiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handles plugin management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides a set of utility functions that would often get used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Messaging&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Messaging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave warnings, messages and markdown comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave errors, marking the build as failed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post any of the above of the above inside a file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a GitHub review, and use the above messaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Plugins&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure for shared rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opens up the ability to validate tricky things with an easy API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The API differs between the JS and Ruby version, not drastically - but there are no plugins for Danger JS yet. That&#39;s still a bit away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;OK..got.it.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OK, got it.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s cover a few examples of the kind of tests can you write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Checking.for.changes.to.a.specific.file&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Checking for changes to a specific file&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking for a CHANGELOG. This was the first rule imagined for Danger, I add it to every project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first implementation of this rule can just be a check if the file &lt;code&gt;CHANGELOG.md&lt;/code&gt; is modified in any PR, that can then be
revised to also check whether there are git changes related to your app. Then documentation, README, tooling updates
don&#39;t require an entry. We also check if the PR title says &quot;trivial&quot; and skip the CHANGELOG check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in standardizing on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/&quot;&gt;keepachangelog.com&lt;/a&gt; format there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dblock/danger-changelog&quot;&gt;danger-changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other examples around this is pinging specific people when a file has changed, or failing if a file that&#39;s never meant
to be modified is changed, warning about potential semantic version updates for changes to specific files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Checking.the.results.of.command-line.tools&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Checking the results of command-line tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Artsy developer blog runs both a spell checker, and a prose linter. These report back on files added or
modified during the PR. As someone known for writing loose and quick, having a machine provide some automatic feedback
makes it easy to not waste my reviewers time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is done by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dbgrandi/danger-prose&quot;&gt;danger-prose&lt;/a&gt; plugin, which wraps both an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lukeapage/node-markdown-spellcheck&quot;&gt;npm module&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amperser/proselint/&quot;&gt;python egg&lt;/a&gt;.
The plugin handles installing and running the CLI, then converts the output into markdown for github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Handling.build.artifacts&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Handling build artifacts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Danger runs after the build process, you can read build logs to provide better feedback. This can range from taking
the results of a test run and posting what has failed (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orta/danger-junit&quot;&gt;danger-junit&lt;/a&gt;), to finding specific strings inside
build logs and highlighting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our native iOS app, when a developer accidentally adds code which accesses the network in a test. That is logged out
during the build. Then later, danger will read the logs to find any mentions of this and post it in the comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;PR.Metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;PR Metadata&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every team&#39;s workflow is different, but it&#39;s pretty common to use a tool other than code review for keeping track of a project&#39;s momentum. You can use Danger to warn people that they haven&#39;t included a Trello, or JIRA ticket reference on
every PR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar approach could be to warn if someone is sending a PR to a branch other than the preferred branch. This works
well if you use the git-flow model for branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We nearly always add a check to see if someone is assigned to a PR, and warn it it&#39;s unassigned in front-end projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Using.the.platform.API&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Using the platform API&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no limits here, by using the API from your platform you can perform any sorts of checks. In the Danger repo
we use the GitHub API to note whether someone is in the Danger org, to remind the core team to invite them to the org
after submitting a PR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Introducing.Danger&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introducing Danger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, maybe that&#39;s got you thinking &lt;em&gt;&quot;ah, I know a process I can automate&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be easy to try and jump straight from no Dangerfile to a many-hundred lined complex set of cultural rules. I&#39;d advise against introducing a long list of rules for Danger all at once. In my experience, gradual integration works better. The entire team may have agreed on the changes upfront, but slower adoption has worked better for teams new to working with Danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Artsy we&#39;ve found that first just integrating Danger with a single simple rule (like checking for a CHANGELOG entry) then starting to introduce them piece-meal from different contributors has made it easier to go from &quot;Ah, we shouldn&#39;t do that again&quot; to &quot;Oh, we could make a Danger rule for that&quot; to &quot;Here&#39;s the PR&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Which.Danger.should.I.use.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Which Danger should I use?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This definitely depends on the project, there&#39;s a longer discussion &lt;a href=&quot;http://danger.systems/js/js-vs-ruby.html&quot;&gt;on the site&lt;/a&gt; too, but here&#39;s the main gist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danger Ruby&lt;/strong&gt; is more mature, has more features, a solid plugin eco-system and covers more platforms. It&#39;s in a great place and is unlikely to have breaking changes from this point onwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danger JS&lt;/strong&gt; has a bigger potential for growth, is &quot;stable enough&quot;, you can create plugins and will be able to do things that the Ruby version could not - eventually. Right now it only works with GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Onwards.and.Upwards&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Onwards and Upwards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the JavaScript version of Danger in a great place ready for production, I can start more serious work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danger/peril#peril&quot;&gt;Peril&lt;/a&gt;. Peril is a hosted web-service that runs Dangerfiles against GitHub events, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danger/peril/blob/master/VISION.md&quot;&gt;the VISION.md&lt;/a&gt;. Those events span from a new user being created, to a new issue on a repo. Peril lets you run your own complex rules across an entire org. This can be a really powerful way to audit and improve entire-company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started using Peril in Artsy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/reaction-force/pull/184&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. So it&#39;s starting to become a thing internally. It&#39;ll be awesome to explore the idea of org-wide rules. I think we&#39;re starting with making sure we assign someone on a PR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So give Danger a shot, and if you&#39;re bold. give &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danger/peril#peril&quot;&gt;Peril&lt;/a&gt; a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Encrypting ActiveRecord Fields Without Downtime.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After examining the data stored in one of our high-throughput systems, we realized it might include sensitive user data. To reduce the number of people that are technically able to access the data and reduce the risks associated with a potential data theft, we decided to encrypt certain database fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Our.Goal&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Our Goal&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encrypt sensitive fields without any downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Approach&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Approach&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we wanted to encrypt existing rows, new rows were constantly being added. In order to achieve zero downtown we have devised the following path:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add new &lt;em&gt;encrypted&lt;/em&gt; fields to the database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start populating new &lt;em&gt;encrypted&lt;/em&gt; fields with &lt;em&gt;encrypted&lt;/em&gt; values while still populating &lt;em&gt;un-encrypted&lt;/em&gt; fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the background, migrate existing records by populating their &lt;em&gt;encrypted&lt;/em&gt; fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor to use &lt;em&gt;encrypted&lt;/em&gt; fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop &lt;em&gt;un-encrypted&lt;/em&gt; fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Each step above was relatively simple and was tested properly before moving to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Choosing.an.Encryption.Library&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choosing an Encryption Library&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at a few gems, mainly &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/attr-encrypted/attr_encrypted&quot;&gt;attr_encrypted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jmazzi/crypt_keeper&quot;&gt;crypt_keeper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rocketjob/symmetric-encryption&quot;&gt;symmetric-encryption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all these libraries were reliable, we used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rocketjob/symmetric-encryption&quot;&gt;symmetric-encryption&lt;/a&gt;, based on its robust &lt;a href=&quot;https://rocketjob.github.io/symmetric-encryption/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, ease of use and easy integration with other libraries (in our case &lt;code&gt;ActiveRecord&lt;/code&gt;). It provides some useful &lt;a href=&quot;https://rocketjob.github.io/symmetric-encryption/rake_tasks.html&quot;&gt;Rake tasks&lt;/a&gt; for configurations inside/outside of Heroku. Overall &lt;code&gt;symmetric-encryption&lt;/code&gt; seemed really 🔒 .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;config/symmetric-encryption.yml&lt;/code&gt; file is used to define what algorithm to use and where to find the related keys for different environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symmetric Encryption uses OpenSSL to encrypt and decrypt the data which means we are able to use any of the algorithms supported by OpenSSL. We used &lt;code&gt;aes-256-cbc&lt;/code&gt; which is also the recommended default algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create a new set of keys:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;bash&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;rails generate symmetric_encryption:new_keys production
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Above command will create an encryption key and an Initialization Vector (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector&quot;&gt;IV&lt;/a&gt;). Generated key &lt;strong&gt;must not&lt;/strong&gt; be committed into source code. Depending on how your application is deployed, there are two approaches for storing this key. In both scenarios encryption keys are encrypted before storing on file/environment variable. Secret used for encrypting the encryption key itself can be committed into source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To access sensitive data, a malicious party would require access to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our source code,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encryption keys from files or configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Outside.of.Heroku&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Outside of Heroku&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key can be stored in a file on disk outside of source code. We can use &lt;code&gt;key_filename&lt;/code&gt; in configuration &lt;code&gt;yml&lt;/code&gt; to point to this file. In this scenario we would use the operating system to limit access to key file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample configuration file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;yaml&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#config/symmetric_encryption.yml&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   Recommended values:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#      aes-256-cbc&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#         Ruby 1.8.7 MRI Approximately 100,000 encryptions or decryptions per second&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#      aes-128-cbc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#         128 AES CBC Algorithm. Less strong.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#         Ruby 1.8.7 MRI Approximately 100,000 encryptions or decryptions per second&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#         JRuby 1.6.7 with Ruby 1.8.7 Approximately 22,000 encryptions or decryptions per second&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;cipher_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;aes-256-cbc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;On.Heroku&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On Heroku&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the filesystem on Heroku is &lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#ephemeral-filesystem&quot;&gt;ephemeral&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;symmetric-encryption&lt;/code&gt; suggests to set encryption key as an environment variable. Configuration is same as above except we replace &lt;code&gt;key_filename&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;encrypted_key: &quot;&amp;lt;%= ENV[&#39;PRODUCTION_ENCRYPTION_KEY1&#39;] %&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the following rake task to generate a Heroku-specific configuration file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;yaml&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;rails g symmetric_encryption:heroku_config&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This creates a &lt;code&gt;config/symmetric-encryption.yml&lt;/code&gt; file and also outputs commands you can run to set the &lt;em&gt;encrypted&lt;/em&gt; encryption key on Heroku as an environment variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;ActiveRecord.Integration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ActiveRecord Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symmetric Encryption provides a seamless integration with &lt;code&gt;ActiveRecord&lt;/code&gt;. We can use &lt;code&gt;attr_encrypted&lt;/code&gt; helper method to define &lt;em&gt;encrypted&lt;/em&gt; fields. Let&#39;s say we wanted to encrypt a &lt;code&gt;Note&lt;/code&gt; model that has &lt;code&gt;note&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;subject&lt;/code&gt;. You can add the following to your &lt;code&gt;ActiveRecord&lt;/code&gt; model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;ruby&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# app/models/note.rb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;attr_encrypted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:note&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;attr_encrypted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:subject&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This means whenever you set &lt;code&gt;note&lt;/code&gt; for this model &lt;code&gt;symmetric-encryption&lt;/code&gt; will set &lt;code&gt;encrypted_note&lt;/code&gt; field in the database. Whenever you retrieve an instance of this model, &lt;code&gt;symmetric-encryption&lt;/code&gt; will decrypt &lt;code&gt;encrypted_note&lt;/code&gt; field and you can access &lt;em&gt;decrypted&lt;/em&gt; value by just accessing &lt;code&gt;note&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case we couldn&#39;t use this helper immediately. Using encrypted_attr would prevent us from directly accessing the existing, un-encrypted fields in our database (which is necessary through step 3 in our approach). To work around this, we started by adding a &lt;code&gt;before_validation&lt;/code&gt; callback to our model to set encrypted fields based on un-encrypted ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;ruby&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# app/models/note.rb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;before_validation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:encrypt_notes_fields&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;encrypt_note_fields&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encrypted_note&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;SymmetricEncryption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encrypt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encrypted_subject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;SymmetricEncryption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;encrypt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the above code &lt;code&gt;SymmetricEncryption.encrypt(note, true, true, :string)&lt;/code&gt; means encrypt &lt;code&gt;note&lt;/code&gt; field, use random IV(Initialization Vector), compress the string and also use string when decrypting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we got to the 4th step and stopped populating/reading un-encrypted fields we can easily switch above to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;ruby&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# app/models/note.rb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;attr_encrypted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:note&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;attr_encrypted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:subject&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Query.encrypted.fields&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Query encrypted fields&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally when we encrypt a field we can&#39;t do a partial query on the content of that field. On the other hand if we use the same IV each time we encrypt a value, we can do an exact match query. Using same IV means encrypting the same value always end up with the same encrypted string. If exact match query is not something you need, the recommended approach is to use random IV for each encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this approach we were able to encrypt a database with ~1.5 million rows without any downtime in about a week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>iOS Retrospectives</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, Harvard researcher Amy Edmonson made the unexpected discovery that in hospitals, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250959492_Learning_from_Mistakes_Is_Easier_Said_Than_Done_Group_and_Organizational_Influences_on_the_Detection_and_Correction_of_Human_Error&quot;&gt;higher performing teams reported making more mistakes&lt;/a&gt;. This is unexpected because one would assume that &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; performers would make &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; mistakes. In fact, the number of mistakes isn&#39;t what distinguishes higher-performing teams, but rather it&#39;s their attitude towards discussing – and learning from – their failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve spent the past eight months reading more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety&quot;&gt;psychological safety&lt;/a&gt;: the shared belief that team members won&#39;t be punished for speaking up with mistakes or questions or ideas. As a result, I&#39;ve been trying to operationalize psychological safety on my own team, and part of that includes discussing and learning from our mistakes. At Artsy, we candidly discuss site outages or production bugs on the web, but haven&#39;t historically been great at communicating about iOS problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start doing more retrospectives after things go wrong. So this week, I held my first iOS retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It consisted of three parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s discuss each one. And remember: the most important part of a bug retrospective is to &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt;. Encourage others to ask questions, or propose ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Prep.Work&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prep Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prep work involved adapting Artsy&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/19/how-to-write-great-outage-post-mortems/&quot;&gt;site outage post-mortem&lt;/a&gt; for this less serious bug. I drafted a short document with the following information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;: A short paragraph about what happened, and a timeline of when the bug was reported, when it was first introduced, when it was fixed, and when the fix was submitted to the App Store. Include screenshots if available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cause&lt;/strong&gt;: Technical details about the cause of the problem. Include code snippets if appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution&lt;/strong&gt;: Technical details about the fix for the problem, including links to pull requests. The fix was one-line, so I included a git diff as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Mortem&lt;/strong&gt;: A discussion of what contributed to the bug, and how can the team can avoid those problems in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Remember, each section is frame around learning from what went wrong with the goal of preventing similar issues from happening in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preparation took me about a half hour, but would have been faster if I had taken more notes earlier. The bug in question had taken place three weeks ago – I wish I had held the retrospective earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Meeting&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meeting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I invited our Auctions dev team to the meeting and our product manager, but I made it clear that everyone&#39;s attendence was optional. During the meeting, I went through the retrospective document I had prepared, answered some questions, and took some notes for further follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Follow-up&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the meeting, I addressed the follow-up items. In our case, this involved fixing a problem where our staging servers use data that&#39;s not reprepsentive of the data used in production. Additionally, we&#39;ve made changes to how we test certain scenarious in our iOS app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I shared the document with the wider team. In this case, it was the Auctions Operations team. As a developer, I want to empower my teammates to understand why software sometimes behaves unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when should you do a retrospective? The answer is &quot;probably more often than you do now.&quot; I know our team could benefit from more of them, and I think the Artsy Engineering team could too. I&#39;m not concerned about doing them too often – I would rather that than not doing them enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that the benefits of a retrospective aren&#39;t limited to learning from a single mistake; retrospectives encourage a &lt;em&gt;culture&lt;/em&gt; of learning from mistakes, which (as Edmonson discovered in hospital settings) is far more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Relay Mutations</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there everyone, it took us two years to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics/pull/583&quot;&gt;make our&lt;/a&gt; GraphQL implementation support any mutations. We opted to keep it read-only for quite a long time because we use GraphQL to consolidate multiple APIs, but as we start new projects as GraphQL + databases then understanding mutations becomes much more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, I talked with the team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graph.cool/&quot;&gt;Graph.cool&lt;/a&gt; about having them talk through Relay mutations comprehensively as a guest post on the Artsy Engineering blog. So, I&#39;m really excited to introduce this great post on the topic by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/nikolasburk&quot;&gt;Nikolas Burk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- Orta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;The.Magic.behind.Relay.Mutations&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Magic behind Relay Mutations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/relay/&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful GraphQL client for React and React Native applications. It was open sourced by Facebook alongside GraphQL in 2015 and is a great tool for supporting you with managing your app&#39;s data layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we are going to explore how Relay mutations work by looking at a React Native app. The code can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/graphcool-examples/react-native-relay-pokedex-example&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Our sample application is a simple &lt;em&gt;Pokedex&lt;/em&gt;, where users can manage their Pokemons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/S21GfEo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: We&#39;re going to assume a basic familiarity with GraphQL in this article. If you haven&#39;t heard of GraphQL before, the &lt;a href=&quot;www.graphql.org&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/06/19/graphql-for-mobile/&quot;&gt;GraphQL for iOS Developers&lt;/a&gt; post are great places to start. If you&#39;re interested in learning more about Relay in general, head over to &lt;a href=&quot;www.learnrelay.org&quot;&gt;Learn Relay&lt;/a&gt; for a comprehensive tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you want to run the example with your own GraphQL server, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graph.cool/graphql-up/&quot;&gt;graphql-up&lt;/a&gt; to quickly spin one up yourself from within your browser. Simply click the pink button and follow the instructions on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graph.cool/graphql-up/new?source=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphcool-examples/react-native-relay-pokedex-example/master/pokedex.schema&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.graph.cool/images/graphql-up.svg&quot; alt=&quot;graphql-up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Relay.-.A.brief.Overview&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Relay - A brief Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relay is the most sophisticated GraphQL client available at the moment. Like GraphQL, it has been used and battle-tested internally by Facebook for many years before it was open sourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relay surely isn&#39;t the easiest framework to learn - but when used correctly, it takes care of managing large parts of your app&#39;s data layer in a consistent and reliable manner! It therefore is particularly well-suited for complex applications with lots of data interdependencies and provides outstanding longterm developer productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Declarative.API.and.Colocation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Declarative API and Colocation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Relay, React components specify their data requirements in a declarative fashion, making use of GraphQL &lt;em&gt;fragments&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://learngraphql.com/basics/fragments&quot;&gt;GraphQL fragment&lt;/a&gt; is a selection of fields on a GraphQL type. You can use them to define &lt;em&gt;reusable sub-parts&lt;/em&gt; of queries or mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the &lt;code&gt;PokemonDetails&lt;/code&gt; view above, we need to display the Pokemon&#39;s name and image. The fragment that represents these data requirements looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;fragment PokemonDetails on Node {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  ... on Pokemon {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    id
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    name
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    url
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; is required so that Relay can identify the objects in the cache, so it&#39;s included in the payload as well (even if it&#39;s not displayed on the UI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These fragments are kept in the same file as the React component, so UI and data requirements are &lt;em&gt;colocated&lt;/em&gt;. Relay then uses a &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html&quot;&gt;higher-order component&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-containers.html#content&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Relay.Container&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to wrap the component along with its data requirements. From this point, the developer doesn&#39;t have to worry about the data any more! It will be fetched behind the scenes and is made available to the component via its props.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Build-time.Schema.Validation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build-time Schema Validation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great feature of Relay that ensures developer productivity is  &lt;em&gt;schema validation&lt;/em&gt;. At build time, Relay checks your GraphQL queries, fragments and mutations to ensure their compatibility with the GraphQL API. It is thus able to catch any typos or other schema-related errors before you run (or even worse: deploy) your app, saving your users from unpleasant experiences. Note that the schema validation step requires a &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-babel-plugin.html&quot;&gt;Babel Relay Plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Mutations.in.Relay&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mutations in Relay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;GraphQL.Recap&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GraphQL Recap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In GraphQL, a &lt;em&gt;mutation&lt;/em&gt; is the only way to create, update or delete data on the server - they effectively are the GraphQL abstraction for &lt;em&gt;changing state&lt;/em&gt; in your backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, creating a new Pokemon in our sample app uses the following mutation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;mutation CreatePokemon($name: String!, $url: String!) {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  createPokemon(input: {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    name: $name,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    url: $url
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  }) {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    # payload of the mutation (will be returned by the server)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    pokemon {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      id 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Notice that mutations, similar to queries, also require a &lt;em&gt;payload&lt;/em&gt; to be specified. This payload represents the information that we&#39;d like to have returned from the server after the mutation was performed. In the above example, we&#39;re asking for the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; of the new &lt;code&gt;pokemon&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;The.Magic:.Declarative.Mutations.....&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Magic: Declarative Mutations 🔮&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relay doesn&#39;t (yet) give the developer the ability to manually modify the data that it stores internally. Instead, with every change, it requires a declarative &lt;em&gt;description&lt;/em&gt; of how the local cache should be updated after the change happened in the form of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-mutations.html#content&quot;&gt;mutation&lt;/a&gt; and then takes care of the update under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description is provided by subclassing &lt;code&gt;Relay.Mutation&lt;/code&gt; and implementing (at least) four methods that help Relay to properly update the local store:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;getMutation()&lt;/code&gt;: the name of the mutation (from the GraphQL schema)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;getVariables()&lt;/code&gt;: the input variables for the mutation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;getFatQuery()&lt;/code&gt;: a GraphQL query that fetches all data that potentially was changed due to the mutation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;getConfigs()&lt;/code&gt;: a precise specification how the mutation should be incorporated into the cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the following, we&#39;ll take a deeper look at the different kinds of mutations in our sample app, which are used for creating, updating and deleting Pokemons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: We&#39;re using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/relay-api/overview-aizoong9ah&quot;&gt;Graphcool Relay API&lt;/a&gt; for this example. If you used &lt;code&gt;graphql-up&lt;/code&gt; to create your own backend, you can explore the API by pasting the endpoint for the Relay API into the address bar of a browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Creating.a.new.Pokemon:..code.RANGE_ADD..code.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating a new Pokemon: &lt;code&gt;RANGE_ADD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/yskx5KU.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s walk through the different methods and understand what information we have to provide so that Relay can successfully merge the newly created Pokemon into its store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two methods, &lt;code&gt;getMutation()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getVariables()&lt;/code&gt; are relatively obvious and can be retrieved directly from the documentation where the API is described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementations look as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getMutation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;QL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mutation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createPokemon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getVariables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Notice that the &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; of a &lt;code&gt;Relay.Mutation&lt;/code&gt; are passed through its constructor. Here, we simply provide the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; of the Pokemon that is to be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, on to the interesting parts. In &lt;code&gt;getFatQuery()&lt;/code&gt;, we need to specify the parts that might change due to the mutation. Here, we simply specify the &lt;code&gt;viewer&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getFatQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;QL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fragment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CreatePokemonPayload&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;viewer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;allPokemons&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Notice that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; subfield of &lt;code&gt;allPokemons&lt;/code&gt; is also automatically included with this approach. In our example app, &lt;code&gt;allPokemons&lt;/code&gt; is the only point we expect to change after our mutation is performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in &lt;code&gt;getConfigs()&lt;/code&gt;, we need to specify the &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-mutations.html#mutator-configuration&quot;&gt;mutator configurations&lt;/a&gt;, telling Relay exactly how the new data should be incorporated into the cache. This is where the magic happens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getConfigs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;RANGE_ADD&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;viewer&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parentID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;viewerId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;connectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;allPokemons&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;edgeName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;edge&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rangeBehaviors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;append&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We first express that we want to &lt;em&gt;add&lt;/em&gt; the node using &lt;code&gt;RANGE_ADD&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; (there are 5 different types in total).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relay internally represents the stored data as a graph, so the remaining information expresses where exactly the new node should be hooked into the existing structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s consider the shape of the data before we move on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;viewer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;allPokemons&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;edges&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here we clearly see the direct connection between &lt;code&gt;viewer&lt;/code&gt; and the Pokemons goes through &lt;code&gt;allPokemons&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;connection&lt;/em&gt;, so the &lt;em&gt;parent&lt;/em&gt; of the new Pokemon is the &lt;code&gt;viewer&lt;/code&gt;. The name of that connection is &lt;code&gt;allPokemons&lt;/code&gt;, and lastly the &lt;code&gt;edgeName&lt;/code&gt; is taken from the payload of the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last piece, &lt;code&gt;rangeBehaviors&lt;/code&gt;, specifies whether we want to &lt;em&gt;append&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;prepend&lt;/em&gt; the new node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executing the mutation is as simple as calling &lt;code&gt;commitUpdate&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;relay&lt;/code&gt; prop that&#39;s injected to each component being wrapped with a &lt;code&gt;Relay.Container&lt;/code&gt;. An instance of the mutation and the expected variables are passed as arguments to the constructor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_sendCreatePokemonMutation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createPokemonMutation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CreatePokemonMutation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;viewerId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;viewer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pokemonName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pokemonUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;relay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;commitUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createPokemonMutation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Updating.a.Pokemon:..code.FIELDS_CHANGE..code.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Updating a Pokemon: &lt;code&gt;FIELDS_CHANGE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like with creating a Pokemon, &lt;code&gt;getMutation()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getVariables()&lt;/code&gt; are trivial to implement and can be derived directly from the API documentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getMutation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;QL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mutation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;updatePokemon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getVariables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;getFatQuery()&lt;/code&gt;, we only include the &lt;code&gt;pokemon&lt;/code&gt; which includes the updated info this time, since that is the only part we expect to change after our mutation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getFatQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;QL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fragment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UpdatePokemonPayload&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pokemon&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;code&gt;getConfigs()&lt;/code&gt;, this time specifies a mutator configuration of type &lt;code&gt;FIELDS_CHANGE&lt;/code&gt; since we&#39;re only updating properties on a single Pokemon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getConfigs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;FIELDS_CHANGE&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fieldIDs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pokemon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As sole additional piece of info, we declare the ID of the Pokemon that is being updated so that Relay has this information available when receiving the new Pokemon data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Deleting.a.Pokemon:..code.NODE_DELETE..code.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deleting a Pokemon: &lt;code&gt;NODE_DELETE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As before, &lt;code&gt;getMutation()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getVariables()&lt;/code&gt; are self-explanatory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getMutation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;QL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mutation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;deletePokemon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getVariables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, in &lt;code&gt;getFatQuery()&lt;/code&gt;, we need to retrieve the &lt;code&gt;pokemon&lt;/code&gt; from the mutation payload:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getFatQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;QL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fragment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DeletePokemonPayload&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pokemon&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;getConfigs()&lt;/code&gt;, we&#39;re getting to know another mutator configuration type called &lt;code&gt;NODE_DELETE&lt;/code&gt;. This one requires a &lt;code&gt;parentName&lt;/code&gt; as well as a &lt;code&gt;connectionName&lt;/code&gt;, both coming from the mutation payload and specifying where that node existed in Relay&#39;s data graph. Another requirement, that is specifically relevant for the implementation of a GraphQL server, is that the mutation payload of a deleting mutation always needs to return the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; of the deleted node so that Relay can find that node in its store. Taking all of this together, our implementation of &lt;code&gt;getConfigs()&lt;/code&gt; can be written like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getConfigs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;NODE_DELETE&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;pokemon&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;connectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;edge&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;deletedIDFieldName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;deletedId&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Wrapping.Up&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relay has a lot of benefits that make it a very compelling framework to use for state management and interaction with GraphQL APIs. Its major strengths are a highly optimized cache, thoughtful UI integration as well as the declarative API for data fetching and mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial version of Relay came with a notable learning curve due to lots of magic happening behind the scenes. However, Facebook recently released the first release candidates of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/relay/releases/&quot;&gt;Relay v1.0.0&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Relay Modern&lt;/em&gt;) with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.facebook.com/posts/1362748677097871&quot;&gt;goal of making Relay generally more approachable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s worth noting that Relay isn&#39;t the only available GraphQL client. Apollo Client is a great alternative which is a lot easier to get started with. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graph.cool/docs/tutorials/relay-vs-apollo-iechu0shia/&quot;&gt;For a detailed comparison please refer to this article.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Calculating the Importance of an Artwork with Apache Spark</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How important is a single artwork within the artist&#39;s body of work? At Artsy we try to answer this question by extracting and scoring a set of features across roughly one million artworks. We call it an &lt;em&gt;iconicity&lt;/em&gt; score and we calculate that in Apache Spark for the entire dataset in under 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Extracting.Features&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Extracting Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we retrieve artwork features (eg. artwork size or number of users that liked the work), artist features (eg. number of users following an artist), the origin of the work (eg. the work is in a museum) and art genome data (eg. an art historically important sculpture) from HDFS using Hive. Here&#39;s a subset of the query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Vector&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Vectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numArtistFollowers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;toDouble&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isMuseumWork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;toDouble&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Normalizing.and.Weighing.Features&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Normalizing and Weighing Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since having 10,000 artist followers doesn&#39;t make a work 10,000 times more important than the fact that it belongs to a museum, we must normalize them for unit variance across the entire data set. This is also a good time to weigh some features more than others according to our understanding of the art world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;normalize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;features&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;features&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;artworkId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;weightAdjuster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Scoring.Artworks&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scoring Artworks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The score is just the sum of the normalized and weighted features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;scala&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;score&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;normalizedFeatures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;normalizedFeatures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;toArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Storing.Data&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Storing Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We write this data in JSON format to S3, then load it in a system that serves the Artsy API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our dataset this creates a nice distribution. Here&#39;s an example of iconicity across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/artist/banksy/works&quot;&gt;works by the street artist Banksy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017-04-21-calculating-the-importance-of-an-artwork-with-apache-spark/banksy-iconicity.png&quot; alt=&quot;banksy iconicity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We notably sort works by iconicity in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/search?q=banksy&quot;&gt;search results&lt;/a&gt; and in the carousel on top of artist pages. We also have made it available in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.artsy.net&quot;&gt;public API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Artsy&#39;s Technology Stack, 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;a name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;History&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artsy was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is-mapping-the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html&quot;&gt;launched in 2012 as the &quot;Art Genome Project&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and grew exponentially ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2014 we had 230,000 works of art from 600 museums and institutions and launched our first business, a subscription service for commercial galleries, bringing over 80,000 works for sale and partnerships with 37 art fairs and a handful of benefit auctions. That year collectors from 82 countries inquired on over $5.5B of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2015 we doubled our &quot;for sale&quot; inventory and aggregated 4,000 of the world&#39;s leading galleries and 60 art fairs. We also launched two new businesses: commercial auctions and online media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in 2016 we, again, doubled our paid gallery network size to become the largest gallery network in the world and grew to become the most-read online art publication as our highly engaging editorial traffic ballooned 320%. We also launched a platform to bid in live auctions and a consignments service with all major auction houses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;The.Artsy.Business.in.2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Artsy Business in 2017&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artsy in 2017 is a very wide platform and it can be challenging to characterize simply. But when you boil it down to its essence, Artsy offers information and a marketplace. Our written content and fair coverage keep people informed about the art world, and the Art Genome powers our tools for exploration. Through our partnerships with the major player in the art market, galleries and auction houses, we offer our users a unified platform for buying and selling art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally we consider Artsy to have three businesses: &lt;em&gt;Auctions&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Content&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Listings&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Auctions&lt;/em&gt;: Auction houses and charities use Artsy as a sales channel for a commission because collectors want to discover and buy art in a single, central platform that excels at surfacing the art they want from a global market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content&lt;/em&gt;: Brands pay Artsy to reach the first art audience at scale by enabling evergreen content online and for offline engagement during art world events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listings&lt;/em&gt;: Galleries, Fairs and Institutions subscribe to Artsy for a fee because we bring a very large audience of art collectors and enthusiasts to their virtual doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Artsy team is now 166 employees across three offices in New York, Berlin and London. The Engineering organization is now 28 engineers, including 4 leads, 3 directors and a CTO. In this post, we&#39;d like to comprehensively cover what, and how we make the technical and human sides of Artsy businesses work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Organizational.Structures&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Organizational Structures&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, we &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/03/28/artsy-engineering-organization-stack&quot;&gt;updated the Engineering organization&lt;/a&gt; to be oriented around product verticals for businesses. We used to focus more on practices to group engineers working with the same technologies across product teams to facilitate knowledge sharing and avoid redundant efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, web and mobile &quot;practices&quot; have largely been subsumed into the separate product teams. Mobile&#39;s increasing reliance on React Native has aligned nicely with web tooling. It no longer made sense to keep the teams separate, so where product teams used to have 2 separate sub-teams of engineers, they&#39;ve now merged into 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Platform &quot;practice&quot; has remained as a way to coordinate and share work among product teams, as well as monitor and upgrade Artsy&#39;s platform over time. Most platform engineers operate from within product teams, while a few focusing on data and infrastructure form a core, dedicated Platform team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;User.Facing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;User Facing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the user-facing focus is on being able to present interfaces with a quality worthy of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you see today when you go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://artsy.net&quot;&gt;www.artsy.net&lt;/a&gt; is a website built with &lt;a href=&quot;http://ezeljs.com&quot;&gt;Ezel.js&lt;/a&gt;, which is a boilerplate for &lt;a href=&quot;http://backbonejs.org&quot;&gt;Backbone&lt;/a&gt; projects running on &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt; and using &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressjs.com&quot;&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://browserify.org&quot;&gt;Browserify&lt;/a&gt;. We used to have separate projects for mobile and desktop web, but they &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/force/pull/890&quot;&gt;are now merged&lt;/a&gt;. The combined app is hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://heroku.com&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; and uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://redis.io&quot;&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt; for caching. Assets, including artwork images, are served from &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/s3&quot;&gt;Amazon S3&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront&quot;&gt;CloudFront CDN&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/force&quot;&gt;code is open-source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you see today when you open the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/artsy-collect-and-bid-on-fine-art-design/id703796080?mt=8&quot;&gt;Artsy iOS app&lt;/a&gt; is a mix of Objective-C, Swift and React Native. Objective-C and Swift continue to provide a lot of over-arching cross-View Controller code. While individual representations of Artsy resources tend to be built in React Native. All of our React Native code uses Relay to handle API integration. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/eigen&quot;&gt;code is open-source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also find Artsy on &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexa.artsy.net&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://assistant.artsy.net&quot;&gt;Google Home&lt;/a&gt;, which are both open-source Node.js applications. There is also an open-source &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emergence/&quot;&gt;Apple TV&lt;/a&gt; app built in Swift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our core API serves the public facets of our product, many of our own internal applications, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.artsy.net&quot;&gt;some of your own projects&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-lang.org/en&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rack.github.io&quot;&gt;Rack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/intridea/grape&quot;&gt;Grape&lt;/a&gt; serving primarily JSON. The API is hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks&quot;&gt;AWS OpsWorks&lt;/a&gt; and retrieves data from several &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mongodb.com&quot;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; databases hosted with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.compose.io&quot;&gt;Compose&lt;/a&gt;. It also uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://memcached.org&quot;&gt;Memcached&lt;/a&gt; for caching and &lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io&quot;&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt; for background queues with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/&quot;&gt;Sidekiq&lt;/a&gt;. It runs background jobs with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job&quot;&gt;delayed_job&lt;/a&gt;. We used to employ &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucene.apache.org/solr&quot;&gt;Apache Solr&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/cse&quot;&gt;Google Custom Search&lt;/a&gt; for the many search functions, but have since consolidated on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co&quot;&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most modern code for both the website and the iOS app use an orchestration layer which is powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://graphql.org&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; to streamline their data fetching and reduce front-end complexity. Our GraphQL server is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressjs.com&quot;&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt; app, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql&quot;&gt;express-graphql&lt;/a&gt; to provide a single API end-point. The API does not access our data directly, but forwards requests to the core API or other services. We have been migrating shared display logic into the GraphQL server, to make it easier to build consistent clients. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics&quot;&gt;code is open-source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistently, our front-end code &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/&quot;&gt;has moved towards&lt;/a&gt; using React across all platforms along with introducing stricter JavaScript languages like TypeScript over CoffeeScript in order to provide better tooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue to have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.artsy.net&quot;&gt;public HAL+JSON API&lt;/a&gt; for external developers. This API is in active use for contemporary production services inside Artsy and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/doppler&quot;&gt;website is open-source&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Partner-Facing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Partner-Facing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast customer-facing business is powered by a Content Management System (CMS) for gallery and institutional partners. This CMS lets them upload and manage gallery shows, fair booths, create artists, and edit artwork metadata. All CMS components talk to our core API. We also have a number of CMS-like internal applications to manage partners, auctions, art genomes, configuring fairs or performing recurrent billing (we use Stripe for storing and charging credit cards and ACH) with invoicing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMS applications are based on stable, mature technologies like &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks&quot;&gt;Turbolinks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeescript.org&quot;&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt;, and gradually adopts modern client-side technologies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://browserify.org&quot;&gt;Browserify&lt;/a&gt;. They share a lot of common infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a generic image-processing service in-house, which uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/&quot;&gt;Sidekiq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io&quot;&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick&quot;&gt;RMagick&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php&quot;&gt;ImageMagick&lt;/a&gt;. It receives image processing requests from many Artsy applications and generates thumbnails, tiles and watermarks images on S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Collector-Facing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Collector-Facing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectors inquire on artworks and engage in conversations with partners. For this purpose we have built a generic messaging system that manages communications between different parties. It receives messages via API or e-mail, finds or creates a conversation based on the recipients and forwards them to the proper addresses in that conversation. Its doesn&#39;t assume anything about the contents of the messages, which makes it a generic system for any type of conversation. The conversations surface to our partners via CMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Running.Auctions&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Running Auctions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Auctions business began with doing the occasional benefit auctions for charities. Most of these auctions are online-only, timed sales. The initial version of our auction systems came together before we began our move to microservices, and so it is baked into our core API. Last year, we launched a live auction integration product to allow users to bid on works at commercial sales at the actual auction house sale rooms. The real-time requirements of this system required a rethinking of how we process our bids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core API for a commercial auction is a Scala micro-service that uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://akka.io&quot;&gt;Akka&lt;/a&gt; for distributed computing. It stores information in an append-only storage engine, based on Akka Persistence, with a small library we developed called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/atomic-store&quot;&gt;atomic-store&lt;/a&gt;. Communication with external clients can either be done via a REST API, or via WebSockets. People visiting a Live Auction on the web are interacting with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9#.ev1yd3juy&quot;&gt;universal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;+&lt;a href=&quot;http://redux.js.org&quot;&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt; JavaScript app, served from an &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressjs.com&quot;&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt; server. Bidders visiting a Live Auction on iOS are interacting with a Swift application built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JensRavens/Interstellar&quot;&gt;Interstellar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/daltoniam/starscream&quot;&gt;Starscream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON&quot;&gt;SwiftyJSON&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more detailed overview of the Auctions stack can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/08/09/the-tech-behind-live-auction-integration&quot;&gt;The Tech Behind Live Auction Integration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Publishing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publishing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our in-house editorial team and partners use an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/positron&quot;&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt; platform called &quot;Writer&quot; (which we&#39;ve built) to publish rich content across the web. Writer is split in two parts: the editorial-focused CMS and a JSON API that stores and distributes content separately from the rest of Artsy&#39;s stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writer&#39;s frontend is built with &lt;a href=&quot;http://ezeljs.com&quot;&gt;Ezel.js&lt;/a&gt;, which is a boilerplate for &lt;a href=&quot;http://backbonejs.org&quot;&gt;Backbone&lt;/a&gt; projects running on &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt; and using &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressjs.com&quot;&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://browserify.org&quot;&gt;Browserify&lt;/a&gt;. We also heavily use &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; and write in &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeescript.org&quot;&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt;. Writer&#39;s backend exposes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer&quot;&gt;REST&lt;/a&gt;-based and &lt;a href=&quot;http://graphql.org&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; APIs that are consumed by our applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see Writer being put to work when you see articles on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net&quot;&gt;www.artsy.net&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook Instant Articles, Google AMP, RSS, Apple News, and email. We handle the distribution and display in all of these channels. We also support brand sponsorship deals and produce front-end heavy projects such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/2016-year-in-art&quot;&gt;Year in Art 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-2015-the-year-in-art&quot;&gt;Year in Art 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Data.Pipeline&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data Pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data generally flows from consumer applications and services into &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/redshift&quot;&gt;AWS RedShift&lt;/a&gt;. We use a set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/rake&quot;&gt;rake&lt;/a&gt; tasks run on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Flow+Plugin&quot;&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; to move data from our several MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases to Redshift via &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3&quot;&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt;. These rake tasks shell out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-copy.html&quot;&gt;psql&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongoexport&quot;&gt;mongo-export&lt;/a&gt; to generate CSV files for a list of services and upload them to an S3 bucket, then load those CSV files plus others found in that bucket (placed there by other services) into Redshift. If a &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_COPY.html&quot;&gt;Redshift copy&lt;/a&gt; fails due to data changes we sample the CSV and generate a working schema from its contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also store application usage data provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://segment.com/warehouses&quot;&gt;Segment Warehouses&lt;/a&gt; as well as data from vendors such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com&quot;&gt;Salesforce&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sailthru.com&quot;&gt;Sailthru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For production data processing (such as recommendations), large-scale machine learning or even simpler parallel processing such as generating website sitemaps, we have our own Hadoop cluster configured and managed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudera.com/products/product-components/cloudera-manager.html&quot;&gt;Cloudera Manager&lt;/a&gt; and running on EC2. We leverage &lt;a href=&quot;http://spark.apache.org&quot;&gt;Apache Spark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudera.com/products/open-source/apache-hadoop.html&quot;&gt;Hadoop&lt;/a&gt; with some &lt;a href=&quot;http://oozie.apache.org&quot;&gt;Ooozie&lt;/a&gt; workflow scheduling. The same data pipeline that writes data to S3 also pumps data to HDFS with either Ruby code or &lt;a href=&quot;http://sqoop.apache.org&quot;&gt;Sqoop&lt;/a&gt; and is read by Spark jobs written in Scala using &lt;a href=&quot;https://hive.apache.org&quot;&gt;Hive&lt;/a&gt;. Spark has improved performance and capacity tenfold over our older in-house systems and we will be moving all lengthy processing implemented in Ruby to this system gradually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For general data access and dashboards we rely on &lt;a href=&quot;https://looker.com&quot;&gt;Looker&lt;/a&gt;. This system empowers all non-engineers to access all of our data. At the time of writing, there are 50 users running 3,500 queries a day against Redshift via Looker. We&#39;ve found it expedient to pre-compute common denormalized views, and to create our own session rollups from raw pageviews and events for the additional flexibility it gives us in understanding user behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more in-depth work, we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipython.org/notebook.html&quot;&gt;Jupyter Notebooks&lt;/a&gt; to connect to our Redshift cluster and by default import &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandas.pydata.org&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scikit-learn.org/stable&quot;&gt;sci-kit learn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html&quot;&gt;pyplot&lt;/a&gt; for data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Search&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Search&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We completed our full migration from &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucene.apache.org/solr&quot;&gt;Solr&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co&quot;&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt; in the last 18 months, and now use Elasticsearch across all front-ends. This ranges from our artwork filter interfaces through to our real-time artwork similarity features. Elasticsearch gives us high availability clustering features out of the box and easy horizontal scaling on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Platform.Services&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Platform Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Artsy&#39;s business has grown more complex, so has the data and concepts handled by its core API. We&#39;ve begun supporting certain product areas with separate, dedicated API services, and even extracting existing API domains into separate services when practical. These services tend to expose simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer&quot;&gt;REST&lt;/a&gt;-ful HTTP APIs, maintain separate data sources, and even do their own &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/10/26/jwt-artsy-journey&quot;&gt;authentication&lt;/a&gt;. This has certain advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each system can be deployed and scaled independently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each chooses the best-suited languages and technologies for its purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code bases remain more focused and developers&#39; cognitive overhead is minimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Balancing these out are some very real disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development must sometimes touch multiple systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some data is copied between services. These can become out-of-sync, though we always try to have a single &lt;em&gt;authoritative&lt;/em&gt; source in such cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploys must be coordinated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At our size and complexity, a single code base is simply impractical. So, we&#39;ve tried to be consistent in the coding, deployment, monitoring, and logging practices of these services. The more repeatable and disciplined our process, the less overhead is introduced by additional systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve also explored alternate communication patterns, so systems aren&#39;t as dependent on each other&#39;s APIs. Recently we&#39;ve begun publishing a stream of data events from our core systems that other systems can consume. Other systems can simply subscribe to the notifications they care about, so the source system doesn&#39;t need to be concerned about integrating with one more destination. After experimenting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://kafka.apache.org&quot;&gt;Kafka&lt;/a&gt; but finding it hard to manage, we switched to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rabbitmq.com&quot;&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose. To provide consistency when publishing events we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/artsy-eventservice&quot;&gt;our own gem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Operations&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Operations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All our recent AWS infrastructure is configured in code using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.terraform.io&quot;&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt;. This approach has allowed us to quickly replicate entire deployments along with their dependencies and has increased visibility into the state of our infrastructure across our teams. We started developing an open source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; workflow toolkit named &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/hokusai&quot;&gt;Hokusai&lt;/a&gt; in order to manage a containerized workflow, CI and deployment to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;. Our Kubernetes clusters are managed using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kops&quot;&gt;Kops&lt;/a&gt; and similarly provisioned using Terraform. This new workflow is reducing our dependence on Heroku, giving us more flexibility in our deployments and a more efficient use of server resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Closing.Remarks&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing Remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any attempts at mapping something as large as the daily work for a thirty-ish person engineering team, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation&quot;&gt;the map is not the territory&lt;/a&gt;. However, the exploration is worth the time it takes to keep notes for reading again in the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in helping us make this an even longer post in two more years, or &lt;em&gt;more interestingly&lt;/em&gt; shorter - we nearly always have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/jobs&quot;&gt;position open for engineers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is fastlane match?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Like anyone working on a non-trivial app in the iOS world who values their time, we use fastlane. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastlane.tools&quot;&gt;fastlane&lt;/a&gt; is a suite
of tools that makes it much simpler to automate the very manual processes provided by Apple for deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve adopted it in a relatively piece-meal manner in different projects, converting custom in-house code to something
provided by the gem.  Over time we found what pieces of the suite work for us. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/energy/pull/266&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve adopted another today&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/match&quot;&gt;match&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;match automates setting up your iOS projects for code signing. One of the most arduous orthogonal tasks which every dev team learns and then forgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In using match, we have given away a bit of control with code signing, and so this post is going to dig into; what we used
to have, and how it works now with match instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When match came out, I knew this was a 🌟 idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically generate the right certificates and keys for your different apps and environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take all your developer certificates and keys, move them to a central place accessible via private git repos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypt all your certs and keys, the team just needs to share one password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migrate all of those keys on both the developer&#39;s and CI&#39;s computers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can now have a consistent signing setup between how you work, and how your CI runs. After understanding this, I migrated
Artsy&#39;s app store apps to deploy via &lt;a href=&quot;https://circleci.com&quot;&gt;Circle CI&lt;/a&gt;. We initially gave match a shot, but ended up having issues with supporting
multiple apps. So, I replicated the core ideas in match into our Fastfile. It looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty neat, huh? It handles the centralization and migration of certificates. The trade-off against match is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We continue to maintain our own certificates, keys and provisioning profiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no easy way to update these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is tooling which makes it easy to see the state of all the code signing process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A year later, on a project which gets no-where near as much developer attention, I discovered that we had got multiple
parts of the certs, keys and profiles wrong when updating our central repo. So, for &lt;a href=&quot;http://folio.artsy.net&quot;&gt;this project&lt;/a&gt;, I have switched to use match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;So.how.does.it.work.now.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So how does it work now?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I ran &lt;code&gt;bundle exec fastlane appstore&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bundle exec fastlane dev&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates the certificates, keys and profiles on iTunes connect and gives you output similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;So..what.is.Match.doing.here.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, what is Match doing here?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;match creates a new key (the &lt;code&gt;*.p12&lt;/code&gt;) - normally you would generate one of these through Keychain, and the entire team would
to share this. We keep ours in team &lt;a href=&quot;http://1password.com&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;. It needs to be used consistently when request certificates from Apple
though the &quot;Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority&quot; part of getting your certs set up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/cert&quot;&gt;cert&lt;/a&gt;: match will use this key &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/14dea61e4c81bf9be13bb86c09aa225c6e572618/cert/lib/cert/runner.rb#L141&quot;&gt;to create a signing request&lt;/a&gt; for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/cert&quot;&gt;cert&lt;/a&gt;: match will generate a certificate for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/14dea61e4c81bf9be13bb86c09aa225c6e572618/cert/lib/cert/runner.rb#L79&quot;&gt;development or distribution&lt;/a&gt; for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/cert&quot;&gt;cert&lt;/a&gt;: match will &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/14dea61e4c81bf9be13bb86c09aa225c6e572618/match/lib/match/runner.rb#L133&quot;&gt;generate a Provisioning Profile&lt;/a&gt; using your certificate and data pulled from your Xcode Project.
In my case, for development and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These profiles are tied directly to one app and the certificate in step 3. For development, all devices in the dev center are also added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These files are then installed in their various methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These files are then moved into your git repo, a commit is made for you, then pushed and the repo is removed from your computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This process is nice, because this ^ is a lot of work. I only had to run a command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would take at about 30 minutes to do this if I knew exactly what I wanted through the web interface + Keychain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently need to do this for every app. This works fine for the app where we are deploying multiple betas a month,
but for one when we&#39;re deploying &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; a beta once a month or two (&lt;em&gt;eek! sorry...&lt;/em&gt;) then it feels like every time you&#39;ve come
back to do some work, the world has shifted a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do lose the fact that we know someone has specifically set everything up to work right at some point, but given how
Xcode updates, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4057241/iphone-what-is-a-wwdr-intermediate-certificate&quot;&gt;WWDR updates&lt;/a&gt; and certificate expirations tend to crop up - it can be frustrating to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So would I move &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/eigen&quot;&gt;Eigen&lt;/a&gt; to match? Maybe, next time something breaks. Till then I think new apps, and less-often updated
apps should use match.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Generating Sitemaps with Apache Spark</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While Artsy is the largest database of Contemporary Art online, it&#39;s not exactly &quot;big data&quot;. To date, we have published over 500,000 artworks by more than 50,000 artists from over 4,000 galleries, 700 museums and institutions across over 40,000 shows. Our team has written thousands of articles, hosted hundreds of art fairs and a few dozen auctions. We have over 1,000 genes from the Art Genome project, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;re just over a million web pages generated from this data on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net&quot;&gt;artsy.net&lt;/a&gt;. Generating sitemaps to submit to Google and other search engines for a million pages never seemed like a big deal. In this post I&#39;ll describe 3 generations of code, including our most recent iteration that uses Apache Spark to generates static sitemap files in S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;What.s.in.a.Sitemap.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What&#39;s in a Sitemap?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re not familiar with sitemaps, they are an easy way for us to inform search engines about pages on artsy.net available for crawling. A Sitemap is an XML file that lists URLs along with some additional metadata. All Artsy sitemaps are listed in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/robots.txt&quot;&gt;robots.txt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;User-agent: *
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;Sitemap: https://www.artsy.net/sitemap-artists.xml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;Sitemap: https://www.artsy.net/sitemap-shows.xml
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These are actually sitemap indexes, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/sitemap-shows.xml&quot;&gt;the shows sitemap index&lt;/a&gt;. Each index contains links to the actual sitemaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;xml&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sitemapindex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;xmlns=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sitemap&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;loc&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;https://www.artsy.net/sitemap-shows-2016.xml&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/loc&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/sitemap&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt; ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/sitemapindex&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Each sitemap contains links to web pages on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net&quot;&gt;www.artsy.net&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/sitemap-shows-2016.xml&quot;&gt;sitemap containing links to shows in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;xml&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;urlset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;xmlns=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;url&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;loc&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;https://www.artsy.net/show/guy-hepner-kate-moss-exhibiton&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/loc&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt; ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/urlset&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;The.Monolith.s.Rake.Task&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Monolith&#39;s Rake Task&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Artsy was a Ruby on Rails monolith we generated and wrote static sitemap files to S3 in a Rake task. We iterated over all our data nightly, created a set of URLs and wrote an XML file. We got fairly clever with a &lt;code&gt;Sitemappable&lt;/code&gt; module that was included in anything that yielded a sitemap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;ruby&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Sitemappable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ActiveSupport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Concern&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;ClassMethods&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sitemappable_priority&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We even used HAML, the same templating system we used to render web pages, to render sitemaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;haml&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;!!! XML&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;%urlset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;xmlns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;documents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sitemappable_urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;%url&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;%loc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course, there were many more implementation details, but adding a sitemap was easy as we made Mongoid models use &lt;code&gt;Sitemappable&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generating sitemaps took a couple of hours and ran nightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;The.Dynamic.Front-End&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Dynamic Front-End&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2015 our front-end was fully decoupled from the monolith that now served as the core API service. The sitemap code still lived there and needed to know about an increasing number of URLs, which seemed totally backwards. We wanted an easier way to maintain and update sitemaps and concluded that by generating sitemaps on the fly we would also see better reflect our live data and prevent 404s in stale sitemaps during crawling. Furthermore, sitemaps increasingly needed information from other places, as we tore the monolith apart into micro-services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our solution for dynamic sitemaps queried the API for the number of total items in every collection, then generated a sitemap index with an entry for each page of results. A subsequent query from Google for a given page would query the API for the actual data that was needed to produce the requested sitemap. You can see the entire code &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/force/tree/2059f8f5e7faa8213221480c1c9cd3c62e9d5ffb/desktop/apps/sitemaps&quot;&gt;in our open-source artsy.net project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked for a while, but introduced new challenges. The first was that we needed individual sitemaps to contain thousands of items or have tens of thousands of sitemaps. That meant tens of megabytes of data returned from either multiple API calls or from a very slow single API query. That problem was even more serious for models that required joining data, and was solved by our first attempt at an orchestration layer that would crawl our own API on a schedule. Today we use GraphQL for that purpose, but we never deprecated the system we put in place during this phase of the sitemap rewrite. That system was barely maintained and riddled with its own issues, starting by the fact that the data crawl began timing out as the amount of data increased sharply. This system quickly became unsustainable as our data grew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;The.Big.gish..Data.Solution&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Big(gish) Data Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016 we started using Apache Spark for calculating similarity graphs and artwork recommendations. We previously loaded a vast majority of our data from many sources into HDFS and wrote Spark jobs in Scala. Having all the data from our multiple databases readily available made our Spark cluster a perfect candidate for a simple need like sitemaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;A.Spark.Job&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Spark Job&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spark job is a Scala class with an entry point that receives some configuration. A typical sitemap fetches data, partitions it, and generates XML sitemap files. This is automatically parallelized and distributed across worker nodes that already have their subset of data locally, making the whole thing blazingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Getting.Data&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Getting Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use Hive to define schemas for all data stored in HDFS. The following example fetches a show ID and its start date/time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;scala&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;HiveContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;SELECT id, start_at FROM shows&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Mapping.Data&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mapping Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We partition sitemaps by date (mostly by year). This helps keep track of how many URLs Google has indexed and makes problems easier to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start by bucketing data for simple objects into tuples of &lt;code&gt;(date, Iterable[String])&lt;/code&gt;. In the following example all shows in 2016 will be grouped together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;scala&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Iterable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;])]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;start_at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getLong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;year&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;DateTimeFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;forPattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;yyyy&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;start_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;groupByKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Generating.Sitemaps&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Generating Sitemaps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each bucket we generate a sitemap. Each sitemap entry is a URL with a &lt;code&gt;loc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;xml&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;def getSitemapEntry(id: String): Elem = {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  val loc = s&amp;quot;https://www.artsy.net/show/${id}&amp;quot;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;url&amp;gt;&amp;lt;loc&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{ loc }&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/loc&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sitemaps cannot contain more than 50,000 items according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html&quot;&gt;sitemap spec&lt;/a&gt;, so we generate files such as &lt;code&gt;sitemap-shows-2016-1.xml&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sitemap-shows-2016-2.xml&lt;/code&gt; when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;scala&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getSitemaps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Iterable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;])])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Writing.Sitemap.Files&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Writing Sitemap Files&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We write a file for each sitemap. The production output goes to S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Writing.Sitemap.Index&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Writing Sitemap Index&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An index is a list of all the sitemaps, also written to S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;scala&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getSitemapsIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sitemapsXml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Elem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sitemap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;https://www.artsy.net/${key}.xml&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sitemap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sitemapindex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;writeSitemapsIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sitemapsXml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;writeFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sitemapsIndexXml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;sitemap-shows.xml&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You also need to do a bit more work to purge files that are no longer generated as data changes. For the shows example above we fetch a list of sitemap files such prefixed by &lt;code&gt;sitemap-shows-&lt;/code&gt; and delete the set difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;scala&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;purgeSitemaps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sitemapsXml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Serving.Sitemaps&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Serving Sitemaps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We serve sitemaps through a Node.js proxy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/force/blob/9eedf063d024ea94e6c32b01497c3fcb7f596d68/desktop/apps/sitemaps/routes.coffee#L42&quot;&gt;in our front-end&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SITEMAP_BASE_URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;http://artsy-sitemaps.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;httpProxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;http-proxy&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;url&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sitemapProxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;httpProxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createProxyServer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SITEMAP_BASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sitemaps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;host&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SITEMAP_BASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sitemapProxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;web&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Results&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We schedule a workflow for each sitemap in Spark with Oozie. Each sitemap job completes in under 5 minutes, which is pretty remarkable given where we started. It will also easily scale to many multiples of our current size as our data continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bringing Artsy to Google Assistant &quot;Home&quot; with Actions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month we &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/11/30/bringing-artsy-to-amazon-echo-alexa/&quot;&gt;brought Artsy to Amazon Alexa&lt;/a&gt;. In this post we&#39;ll repeat that process and enable Artsy for Google Assistant, including Google Home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr You can try Artsy on your Google Home now, say &quot;Ok Google, talk to Artsy&quot; or see &lt;a href=&quot;http://assistant.artsy.net&quot;&gt;assistant.artsy.net&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Conversation.Actions&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conversation Actions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actions are two-way dialogs with users. A user invokes an action, which calls so-called &lt;em&gt;fulfillment&lt;/em&gt; code - a REST endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve never worked with Google Actions, read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/actions/develop/conversation&quot;&gt;conversation actions intro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Actions.SDK&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Actions SDK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To write an action get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/actions/develop/sdk/getting-started&quot;&gt;actions SDK&lt;/a&gt;, which is a node.js client library, describe the actions in JSON and use a command-line tool called &lt;code&gt;gactions&lt;/code&gt; or a web simulator to invoke the action code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Actions.Server&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Actions Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actions SDK can be called from any node.js application, or with some help from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/manekinekko/google-actions-server&quot;&gt;google-actions-server&lt;/a&gt; (GAS) via boilerplate code in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/manekinekko/google-actions-starter&quot;&gt;google-actions-starter&lt;/a&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;code&gt;action.json&lt;/code&gt; that describes the actions, including the invocation trigger for each action and the text-to-speech voice for the agent to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;json&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;versionLabel&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;1.0.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;agentInfo&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;languageCode&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;en-US&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;projectId&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;biesenbach-one&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;invocationNames&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;artsy&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;actions&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;initialTrigger&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;assistant.intent.action.MAIN&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;httpExecution&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;https://biesenbach-one.appspot-preview.com&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The action implementation lives in &lt;code&gt;lib/action.js&lt;/code&gt; that imports and creates a new instance of &lt;code&gt;google-actions-server&lt;/code&gt;, binds intents to functions and issues questions with &lt;code&gt;agent.ask&lt;/code&gt; or sends final responses with &lt;code&gt;assistant.tell&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;          &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;expect_user_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ssml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;final_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;speech_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;text_to_speech&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ssml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;You said hello world.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/biesenbach&quot;&gt;complete source code of the Artsy action on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Local.Simulator&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Local Simulator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GAS does a good job at enabling running of a local development version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; to proxy requests to the outside world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;npm run server&lt;/code&gt; to start the local instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy a preview version of the app with &lt;code&gt;npm run action:autopreview&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;npm run action:simulate&lt;/code&gt; for a local simulator, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/actions/tools/web-simulator&quot;&gt;the web version&lt;/a&gt; or even a Google Home device registered under your development account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_biW8TDbBGo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Certification&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Certification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Fulfillment.Endpoint&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fulfillment Endpoint&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The certification process requires that you deploy the node.js application into a production environment, first. We deployed ours into Google Cloud, which involved creating a &lt;code&gt;vm.yaml&lt;/code&gt;, creating a new deployment with &lt;code&gt;gcloud deployment-manager deployments create production --config vm.yaml&lt;/code&gt;, transpiling JavaScript with &lt;code&gt;npm run build&lt;/code&gt; and deploying the app with &lt;code&gt;gcloud app deploy&lt;/code&gt;. You can just push the app to Heroku or AWS Lambda as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Google.Actions.API.Project&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Google Actions API Project&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a Google Actions API project from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard&quot;&gt;API Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; and configure the project in &quot;Directory Listing&quot;. It&#39;s important to get the sample invocations right, eg. &lt;em&gt;&quot;Ok Google, ask my first action to ...&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Deploy.Action&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Deploy Action&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying the action makes it usable by others by submitting it for approval with Google. Once submitted you have to wait for your action to be rejected or approved, there&#39;s no way to un-submit an action without contacting support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change the &lt;code&gt;httpExecution&lt;/code&gt; URL(s) in &lt;code&gt;action.json&lt;/code&gt; to the deployed fulfillment URL, eg. &lt;code&gt;https://my-first-action.appspot-preview.com&lt;/code&gt;, ensure the correct action ID is used in &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, and run &lt;code&gt;npm run action:deploy&lt;/code&gt;, which will register and deploy your action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application will appear under &quot;Deployment History&quot; in the API dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/2017-03-04-bringing-artsy-to-google-actions-assistant-home/actions-api.png&#39;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Help&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Help&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that the best place to ask questions was &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/actions-on-google&quot;&gt;stack overflow#actions-on-google&lt;/a&gt; and their unusually responsive &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/actions/support/?requesttype=support&amp;amp;prio=low&quot;&gt;support team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Code&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/biesenbach&quot;&gt;complete source code on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Workshop: React Native</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there, so you&#39;ve decided to take a look at React Native? Well, last week I ran a workshop inside Artsy on &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/&quot;&gt;React Native&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/relay/&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video takes you from &lt;code&gt;react-native init&lt;/code&gt; to having the initial structure of a View Controller based on Relay with a real working API request. The video is about 45 minutes, with inline questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to just run through the notes, you could probably get it working in about 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYC47YKnK4k&quot;&gt;to YouTube&lt;/a&gt; for the video, or click more for a smaller inline preview, as well as all of the speakers notes to copy &amp;amp; paste from. There is also a full copy of the end-result at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orta/Relay-Artist-Example&quot;&gt;orta/Relay-Artist-Example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#39;100%&#39; height=&#39;600&#39; src=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PYC47YKnK4k &#39; frameborder=&#39;0&#39; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div class=&#39;meta-container&#39;&gt;&lt;header&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#39;content-container&#39;&gt;&lt;div class=&#39;entry-content&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/orta/Relay-Artist-Example/blob/master/screenshots/workshop.png?raw=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the notes so you can follow along&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Setup&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Setup&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://yarnpkg.com&quot;&gt;Yarn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install React Native - https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new project via &lt;code&gt;react-native init ArtistExample&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Verifying.your.install&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Verifying your install&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd ArtistExample&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;yarn run jest&lt;/code&gt; to verify specs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Starting.out&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Starting out&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;yarn start&lt;/code&gt; - this loads the packager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The packager is the part of React Native which compiles your JavaScript. This JavaScript creates a virtual DOM, which React Native uses to create an equivilent view heirarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;react-native run-ios&lt;/code&gt; to launch the project in a sim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Tada.-.it.s.your.1st.RN.app&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tada - it&#39;s your 1st RN app&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it. Let&#39;s look at some real code. Browse the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Relay&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re using Relay, this will take a bit of setup. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission/commit/c6660fe505f38491f4a1d23dc7f41a2baec5657d&quot;&gt;Here is @alloy setting up Relay in Emission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;relay&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;babel-relay-plugin&lt;/code&gt; - we &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/1061&quot;&gt;use a fork&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;sh&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;yarn add react-relay@https://github.com/alloy/relay/releases/download/v0.9.3/react-relay-0.9.3.tgz
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;yarn add babel-relay-plugin@https://github.com/alloy/relay/releases/download/v0.9.3/babel-relay-plugin-0.9.3.tgz
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then the schema into a data folder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;sh&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;mkdir data
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artsy/emission/master/data/schema.graphql &amp;gt; data/schema.graphql
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artsy/emission/master/data/schema.js &amp;gt; data/schema.js
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artsy/emission/master/data/schema.json &amp;gt; data/schema.json
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then hook up the plugin:
- Add &lt;code&gt;&quot;plugins&quot;: [&quot;./data/schema&quot;],&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.babelrc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;First.edit&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First edit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on Live Reloading and HMR with &lt;code&gt;cmd + d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn BG white. Awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Magic, it does it in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Making.components&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making components&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make &lt;code&gt;lib&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lib/artists&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lib/artists/artist.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move &lt;code&gt;ArtistExample&lt;/code&gt; Component from &lt;code&gt;index.ios.js&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;lib/artists/artist.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the class to &lt;code&gt;Artist&lt;/code&gt;, and edit the title to reflect a different component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back and nuke most of the &lt;code&gt;index.ios.js&lt;/code&gt; make it just refer to `Artist``&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Artist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;./lib/artist/artist&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ArtistExample&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Artist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Relay.Setup&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relay Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explain there are three useful bits &lt;a href=&quot;https://sgwilym.github.io/relay-visual-learners/&quot;&gt;parts of Relay&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Routes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RootContainer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relay.Container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We will talk about them as we go on, but first we need to tell Relay where Metaphysics is. So we need to set up a network layer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;react-relay&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;metaphysicsURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;https://metaphysics-staging.artsy.net&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;injectNetworkLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DefaultNetworkLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;metaphysicsURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;X-XAPP-Token&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;[go to staging.artsy.net and do `sd.ARTSY_XAPP_TOKEN` in console]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next we need to create a Relay Route, this &lt;em&gt;doesnt&lt;/em&gt; directly represent a URL representation, but it often can/does.
E.g. in our case this will represent &lt;code&gt;/artist/:artistID&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create &lt;code&gt;lib/artist/route.js&lt;/code&gt; add&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;react-relay&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ArtistRoute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;queries&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;artist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;QL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;artist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$artistID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;          &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getFragment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;artist&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;paramDefinitions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;artistID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;routeName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;ArtistRoute&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hook this up inside &lt;code&gt;index.ios.js&lt;/code&gt;, add an import, and create instance of Route:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ArtistRoute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;./lib/artist/route&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;glennRoute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ArtistRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;artistID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;glenn-brown&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;  Then change the components render function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See error, that means it&#39;s trying to access a Relay Component, and we have a React component. Let&#39;s make it a Relay Component:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove the &lt;code&gt;export default&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;Artist&lt;/code&gt; class in &lt;code&gt;lib/artist/artist.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add Relay fragment at the bottom&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tada! You&#39;ve made a working relay component. Just start making more of these now, and you have an app!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Looking.Stylish.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Looking Stylish!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, we now have the minimum we need - we got API data coming in as props. Now we want to make it look pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;mkdir assets&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;mkdir assets/fonts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
