        <title>DevSwap: An Experiment in Randomizing Teams</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, every engineer at Artsy went to work for a different team for two full days. We called it DevSwap. In this post, I&#39;ll go over why and how we did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read about Artsy&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/03/28/artsy-engineering-organization-stack/&quot;&gt;Engineering Team&lt;/a&gt; before, you might know that we organize ourselves into product teams that serve different parts of our business. Today, Artsy employs 26 engineers, spread across four product teams — Publishing, Auctions, Collector GMV, and Partner Success. We also have a Platform team that is responsible for systems, infrastructure, and data, among other things. Across these teams, we share systems and apps. To stay cohesive with one another, we also have what we call “practices,” which are cross-team groups that meet and discuss shared tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around two years ago, we didn&#39;t have product teams. Back then, most engineers worked in a variety of stacks. As our business models changed, so did the way we organized ourselves. Interestingly, the number of engineers has not changed drastically, but the way we work has. We have greater focus now that we are organized into product teams with specific business goals, but that means there aren&#39;t as many opportunities to work in other stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this summer, the engineering leads received some feedback from our engineers about wanting more cross-team collaboration and knowledge sharing. In our weekly engineering-wide meeting, we get to hear what features each team is working on, but it can sometimes feel like there&#39;s missing context. Within our practices, there is a better sense of the details, but usually the work itself is deeply nested in another team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We brainstormed several ideas related to knowledge sharing and cross-team collaboration. What stood out the most was that being in product teams meant fewer opportunities to work in other parts of the business. This led to the question: What would happen if we redistributed ourselves into entirely new teams?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Setup&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a few weeks, the engineer leads devised a plan for DevSwap. Here are some questions we asked ourselves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we become closer as a team while learning something new?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we keep ourselves as engineers nimble, flexible, and full-stack?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we reduce risk in our systems by spreading knowledge?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we have fun before summer is over?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For the first iteration, we decided to spend two full business days swapping. Every engineer  worked with a different team. Each team contained the same number of people as the original team. The leads of each team stayed to onboard, provide support and facilitate work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Monday before DevSwap, we had an engineering-wide meeting to go over some guidelines and pick teams. Here are the guidelines we shared:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DevSwap will last 2 days. 🕑&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product managers have been notified so don&#39;t worry about your regular work. Hopefully a new member will pick some up for you 😄.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If possible, try and sit by your new team and if not, coordinate meeting times with remote members. 📞&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See this as a pairing opportunity! 👫&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In terms of work, it&#39;s business as usual. Your new lead will give you guidance. 💼&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this meeting, we also had our leads &quot;pitch&quot; their teams. The goal of this was to get people excited about joining new teams and to get a sense of what projects they might work on. To choose the actual teams, each engineer picked their top three choices and we drew names out of a bucket. If their first choice was already full, we would place them in their next available choice. The following Monday and Tuesday, we were all writing code for different teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;So.what.happened.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what happened?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our EU engineers kicked off DevSwap on Monday, tackling both the struggle of learning new stacks and being remote (our headquarters is located in NYC). Leads mitigated the latter problem by prepping EU folks on Friday so they had some direction come Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was lots of Slack-ing, Screenhero-ing, and pairing. It was wonderful to see people interact in a new environment with new goals, even if it was temporary. Some got to learn about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; teams operate and learned about issue prioritization and even attended meetings with stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people worked on modernizing codebases with projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/positron/pull/1225&quot;&gt;server-side hot file swapping&lt;/a&gt; and the introduction of a GraphQL endpoint to our consignments app. Others worked on building features like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/aprb/pull/104/files&quot;&gt;setting up Slack notifications&lt;/a&gt; when we receive customer feedback and adding ElasticSearch indexing to projects. We learned new languages &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/eigen/pull/2412&quot;&gt;by building features&lt;/a&gt; and updated &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics/pull/702&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/positron/pull/1235&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All work aside, the fact that we were having conversations with each other about the details of the technology while gaining a fresh perspective of someone else&#39;s experience was valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Feedback.from.Engineers&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback from Engineers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot and had fun, but I wondered what everyone else thought. At the end of the second day, I sent out a survey to all 26 engineers and received 14 responses. Here are some of those results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you get a chance to collaborate with someone you don&#39;t normally work with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; seamless frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQoAQpvGiq2-5EJWz__vS0n4Iw9r3rY_eSEaPqKQzUlPnObnono-RFS4qLSjrmGTqGnbMOoQsA1L9WX/pubchart?oid=942845256&amp;amp;format=interactive&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Did you gain a better understanding of a piece of Artsy Engineering you don&#39;t normally interact with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; seamless frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQoAQpvGiq2-5EJWz__vS0n4Iw9r3rY_eSEaPqKQzUlPnObnono-RFS4qLSjrmGTqGnbMOoQsA1L9WX/pubchart?oid=543941925&amp;amp;format=interactive&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If we were to swap again in 6 months, how long should it last?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; seamless frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQoAQpvGiq2-5EJWz__vS0n4Iw9r3rY_eSEaPqKQzUlPnObnono-RFS4qLSjrmGTqGnbMOoQsA1L9WX/pubchart?oid=1071239654&amp;amp;format=interactive&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Would make the swap slightly longer -- was a short timeframe to get through a project.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Onboarding took up most of the time. It was hard to get anything beyond that done.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One clear piece of feedback was the desire to spend more time on an assigned team. Some engineers had trouble onboarding, setting up projects, and accomplishing meaningful work within the two days. If engineers can&#39;t spin up a dev environment within a day, what does that mean for usability? These are solvable problems — we could think about dockerizing apps or having better READMEs. During the session, some folks went back to their old teams to help new members with problems. While this was great, it meant less time for their own learning. One option is to extend the duration of the swap. But by extending it too long, it could remove the hackathon mentality that kept people highly focused. It seems like a combination of tweaking the duration, providing better initial setup, and clearly communicating expectations might help for next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also requested feedback on the leads. Responding to a multiple choice question about what their newly assigned lead did best, most engineers chose &quot;Assisted me when I got stuck&quot; and &quot;Checked in with me frequently.&quot; The least chosen answers were &quot;Taught me something new&quot; and &quot;Made the work enjoyable.&quot; It&#39;s possible that taking more time to prepare for new teams (i.e. introduction meetings, dev environment setup workshop) could provide more opportunities for deeper learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we asked if there were any good takeaways that could be applied to your own team, we had some interesting answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Partner Success does a &#39;show &amp;amp; tell&#39; where you just casually mention something you learned, dev/tech related. That was fun. We should do that on [Collector Experience].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Finally got to play with Redux in a production app, which I&#39;d be very happy to see implemented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/positron&quot;&gt;Positron&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about GraphQL and what it could mean to the [Partner Success] team. Also thinking about what it means for Kinetic and how our projects talk to Gravity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, what did people like most?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Working with people that I normally don&#39;t get a chance to work with on daily basis and also working on the areas of our systems. The fact that now each engineer knows how to setup and run another part of our system by itself is a huge win.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The tight time period forces projects to be very granular. It also forces repo set-up time to be minimized (e.g., via setup/bootstrap scripts, docker, etc.).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I liked feeling like I was able to figure out a codebase that was completely new to me and add value even in the short time that we had to work with. It made me feel like something intimidating was actually within my reach and that made me feel smart. :)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wasn&#39;t sure if we should expect to get much accomplished but was pleasantly surprised to ship a small but useful feature.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Awesome idea, it feels great to be part of the team that takes risks like this to increase teamwork and knowledge share among engineers and give engineers chance to get out of their comfort zone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a few issues with onboarding and timing, it seems that most people found DevSwap to be valuable. This feedback gives us a lot to consider when planning the next one. We hope to bring it back soon!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Modernizing Force</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/force&quot;&gt;Force&lt;/a&gt; is Artsy&#39;s main website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net&quot;&gt;artsy.net&lt;/a&gt;. In the three years since it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/09/05/we-open-sourced-our-isomorphic-javascript-website/&quot;&gt;open-sourced&lt;/a&gt;, it has provided a solid foundation to build features on top of without a lot of the costs associated with growth. It is an early example of Isomorphic (&quot;universal&quot;) JavaScript, built on top of Express, Backbone, CoffeeScript, Stylus and Jade. It is also highly modular, adopting patterns laid down by its parent project,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/ezel&quot;&gt;Ezel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When first developed these technologies made a lot of sense; CoffeeScript fixed many of the problems with JavaScript pre-ES6, and Jade / Stylus made working with HTML / CSS much more elegant. As time progressed and new technologies became a thing these solutions starting feeling more burdensome to continue building features with and many of our developers longed to start using next-generation tools like React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at output from &lt;code&gt;cloc&lt;/code&gt;, the question is &quot;But how?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--------------------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SUM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;                          &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2765&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;216126&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--------------------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;216k+ LOC, spread across multiple languages and formats. Given finite resources and a small team rebuilds can be difficult to execute, and so we had to figure out a way to marry the old with the new while also maintaining backwards compatibility / interoperability. Out of this exercise came a few patterns, libraries and projects that I would like to describe in an effort to help those caught in similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Step.1:.Get.Your.House..aka.Compiler..in.Order&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Get Your House (aka Compiler) in Order&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/&quot;&gt;Babel&lt;/a&gt; has been around for a while, but lately their team has been putting effort into making it as easy as possible to use. By dropping a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/force/blob/master/.babelrc&quot;&gt;.babelrc&lt;/a&gt; file into the root of your project, server and client-side JavaScript can share the same configuration, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tleunen/babel-plugin-module-resolver&quot;&gt;module resolution&lt;/a&gt; (aka, no more &lt;code&gt;../../../&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simplified example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;json&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;.babelrc&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// index.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;babel-core/register&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Start the app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;./boot&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On the client, we use &lt;a href=&quot;http://browserify.org/&quot;&gt;Browserify&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/substack/coffeeify&quot;&gt;Coffeeify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/babel/babelify&quot;&gt;Babelify&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;json&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;assets&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;browserify -t babelify -t coffeeify -o bundle.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;start&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;yarn assets &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node index.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And then boot it up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;sh&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;yarn start
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By adding just a few lines, our existing CoffeeScript pipeline was augmented to support modern JavaScript on both the server and the client, with code that can be shared between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Step.2:.Tune-up.Iteration.Time&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Tune-up Iteration Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question that every developer should ask of their stack is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How long does it take for me to make a change and see that change reflected in a running process?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does your code take one second to compile, or ten? When writing a back-end service, does your server &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/remy/nodemon&quot;&gt;automatically restart&lt;/a&gt; after you make a change, or do you need to &lt;code&gt;ctrl+c&lt;/code&gt; (stop it) and then restart manually?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of us working in Force, the bottleneck typically involved making changes to back-end code. Due to how we organize our sub-apps, client-side code compilation -- after the server heats up -- is pretty much instant, but that heat-up time can often take a while depending on which app we&#39;re working on. So even with a &quot;restart on code change&quot; setup that listens for updates it still felt terribly slow, and this iteration time would often discourage developers from touching certain areas of the codebase. We needed something better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter Webpack and React, which helped popularize the concept of HMR, or &quot;Hot Module Replacement&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Webpack docs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hot Module Replacement (HMR) exchanges, adds, or removes modules while an application is running, without a full reload.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s more like it! But is there anything similar for the server given we don&#39;t use Webpack? This was the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alloy&quot;&gt;@alloy&lt;/a&gt;, one of our Engineering Leads, asked himself while researching various setups that ultimately led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/reaction&quot;&gt;Reaction&lt;/a&gt;, and for which he found an answer to in Glen Mailer&#39;s excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/glenjamin/ultimate-hot-reloading-example&quot;&gt;ultimate-hot-reloading-example&lt;/a&gt;. Digging into the code, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/glenjamin/ultimate-hot-reloading-example/blob/master/server.js#L38-L45&quot;&gt;this little snippet&lt;/a&gt; jumped out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;watcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;ready&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;watcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;all&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Clearing /server/ module cache from server&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/[\/\\]server[\/\\]/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The code seemed simple enough -- on change, iterate through Node.js&#39;s internal require cache, look for the changed module, and clear it out. When the module is &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt;&#39;d at a later point it will be like it was required for the first time, effectively hot-swapping out the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this knowledge we wrapped a modified version of this snippet into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/express-reloadable&quot;&gt;@artsy/express-reloadable&lt;/a&gt;, a small utility package meant to be used with Express.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a full example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;express&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createReloadable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isDevelopment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;@artsy/express-reloadable&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isDevelopment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Listening&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In Force, we mounted this library &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/force/blob/master/lib/setup.js#L205&quot;&gt;at the root&lt;/a&gt;, allowing us to make changes anywhere within our numerous sub-apps and with a fresh page reload instantly see those changes reflected without a restart. This approach also works great with API servers, as this implementation from Artsy&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/positron/blob/master/boot.js#L34&quot;&gt;editorial app Positron&lt;/a&gt; shows. Like magic, it &quot;just works&quot;. Why isn&#39;t this trick more widely used and known?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Step.3:.The.View.Layer..or:.How.I.Stopped.Worrying.and.Learned.to.Love.Legacy.UI&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: The View Layer, or: How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love Legacy UI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one was a bit tricky to solve, but ultimately ended up being fairly straightforward and conceptually simple. In Force, we&#39;ve got dozens of apps built on top of hundreds of components supported by thousands of tests stretched across desktop and mobile. From the perspective of sheer code volume these things aren&#39;t going anywhere any time soon. On top of that, our view templates are built using Jade (now known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://pugjs.org&quot;&gt;Pug&lt;/a&gt;), which supports an interesting form of inheritance known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://pugjs.org/language/inheritance.html&quot;&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt;. What this means in practice is our UI has been extended in a variety of complex ways making alternative view engines difficult on the surface to interpolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to do? It&#39;s 2017 and the era of handlebars templates bound to Backbone MVC views is over. We want &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;! We want &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.styled-components.com/&quot;&gt;Styled Components&lt;/a&gt;! And when those tools are surpassed by the Next Big Thing we want that too! But we also want our existing CoffeeScript and Jade and old-school &lt;code&gt;Backbone.View&lt;/code&gt;s as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking through this problem, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/stitch&quot;&gt;@artsy/stitch&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stitch helps your Template and Component dependencies peacefully co-exist. You feed it a layout and some data and out pops a string of compiled html that can be passed down to the client. &quot;Blocks&quot; can be added that represent portions of UI, injected by key. It aims for maximum flexibility: templating engines supported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js&quot;&gt;consolidate&lt;/a&gt; can be installed and custom rendering engines &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/stitch#custom-renderers&quot;&gt;can be swapped out or extended&lt;/a&gt;. With very little setup it unlocks UI configurations that have been lost to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;html&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  {{title}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;js&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;renderLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;templates/layout.handlebars&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Hello!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// =&amp;gt; Outputs:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;  Hello!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By adding &quot;blocks&quot; you can begin assembling (or adapting to) more complex layouts. Blocks represent either a path to a template or a component (with &quot;component&quot; meaning a React or &lt;a href=&quot;https://preactjs.com&quot;&gt;React-like&lt;/a&gt; function / class component):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Force, we&#39;re using this to pattern to incrementally migrate portions of our app over to React, by taking existing block-based Jade layouts and injecting &lt;code&gt;ReactDOM.renderToString&lt;/code&gt; output into them, and then rendering the layout into an HTML string that is passed down from the server and rehydrated on the client, isomorphically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our existing Backbone views take advantage of the &lt;code&gt;templates&lt;/code&gt; key:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to blocks, templates located in this object are pre-compiled and available to your components as &lt;code&gt;props.templates&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the html has been sent over the wire, we mount it like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the server-side render phase existing template code will be rendered with the component, and once the component is mounted on the client &lt;code&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/code&gt; will fire and the Backbone view instantiated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of the possibilities that Stitch provides are too numerous to go over here, but check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/stitch#usage&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/stitch/tree/master/examples&quot;&gt;example apps&lt;/a&gt; for more complete usage. While new, this pattern has worked quite well for us and has allowed Force to evolve alongside existing code with very little friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Moving.Forward&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common thread that connects &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/force&quot;&gt;Force&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/eigen&quot;&gt;Eigen&lt;/a&gt; (Artsy&#39;s mobile app) is an understanding that while grand re-writes will gladly remove technical debt, technical debt is not our issue. A lot of the patterns we&#39;ve laid down within our apps still work for us, and many of our implementations remain sufficient to the task. What we needed was an environment where &lt;em&gt;incremental revolution&lt;/em&gt; was possible, where old ideas could merge with new and evolve. In terms of Eigen, we felt the best way forward was the adoption of &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/&quot;&gt;React Native&lt;/a&gt; -- and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission&quot;&gt;Emission&lt;/a&gt; was born. Likewise, for our web and web-based mobile apps, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/reaction&quot;&gt;Reaction&lt;/a&gt; is serving a similar role. Both of these projects are built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org/&quot;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt;, and both rely heavily on functionality that our &lt;a href=&quot;http://graphql.org/&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; interface &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics&quot;&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/a&gt; provides. But crucially, these projects &lt;em&gt;augment&lt;/em&gt; our existing infrastructure; they don&#39;t replace it. They fit in with existing ideas, tools and processes that have facilitated Artsy&#39;s growth, including highly-specific domain knowledge that our engineers have built up over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I hope this post has provided a bit of a window into some of our processes here at Artsy for those facing similar challenges. If you want to take a deeper dive, check out the links below:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing Peril to the Artsy Org</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Once Danger Ruby was stable enough for everyday use in 2015, it became obvious that running Danger on CI was both a
positive and a negative. On the positive side, Danger has access to all artifacts created during testing - and on the negative
side it takes a long time to get feedback. It was obvious that Danger could &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danger/danger/issues/42&quot;&gt;run on a server&lt;/a&gt;, but it was a big unknown what that could look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/06/30/danger-one-oh-again/&quot;&gt;I came to the conclusion&lt;/a&gt; that we would need a JavaScript replacement of Danger - and so I applied
constraints to Danger JS that made a server-side version of Danger a possibility. It was a stroke of luck that around the
time Danger JS became usable for day to day usage, that GitHub introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-09-14-Integrations-Early-Access/&quot;&gt;GitHub Apps&lt;/a&gt; - so I started work on Peril. Peril is server-side Danger. The rest of this post talks about how we use it Artsy today, how you can use it yourself and where it&#39;s heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In December 2016, I built out Peril in a sandbox org: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PerilTest&quot;&gt;PerilTest&lt;/a&gt;, this gave me the chance to get a lot of things wrong safely. My biggest worry around Peril was leaking data though someone abusing the ability to evaluate a Dangerfile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2017, I introduced Peril into Artsy&#39;s org, GitHub apps have the ability to pick and choose which repos to work with.
I scoped the repos to existing open source projects which I was familiar with (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission&quot;&gt;Emission&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/reaction&quot;&gt;Reaction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/positron&quot;&gt;Positron&lt;/a&gt;)
which gave a space to ensure stability and handle production edge-cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2017, I created a new Peril instance for CocoaPods. I then finally flipped the switch to turn Peril on for all
repos on the Artsy org and formalized the RFC process for changes. This is where we are now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Getting.Set.Up&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Set Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our Artsy org, I followed and improved the guide: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danger/peril/blob/master/docs/setup_for_org.md&quot;&gt;Setup for Org&lt;/a&gt;. There are three key components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a GitHub app for your Org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosting a Peril server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making up a Peril settings repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The guide covers the initial setup, but I&#39;d like to cover the third part of our setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;How.Artsy.s.Peril.works&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Artsy&#39;s Peril works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Artsy Peril settings are all on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/artsy-danger&quot;&gt;artsy/artsy-danger&lt;/a&gt;. The Artsy Peril heroku instance has the ENV var
&lt;code&gt;&quot;DATABASE_JSON_FILE&quot;&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code&gt;&quot;artsy/artsy-danger@peril.settings.json&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, so Peril will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/artsy-danger/blob/master/peril.settings.json&quot;&gt;that file&lt;/a&gt; as the source of truth for all config. Here&#39;s what it is today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;article class=&#39;split-desktop-only&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#39;flex:1; display: block;&#39;&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div style=&#39;flex:1; display: block; padding:0 20px;&#39;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;settings&quot;:&lt;/code&gt; These settings which conform to today&#39;s &lt;a href=&#39;https://github.com/danger/peril/blob/752afeb37e3c1fdec512eb91687747d9a8a29337/source/db/index.ts#L26-L31&#39;&gt;GitHubInstallationSettings&lt;/a&gt;, here&#39;s the &lt;a href=&#39;https://github.com/danger/peril/blob/master/source/db/index.ts&#39;&gt;current version&lt;/a&gt;. These are org-wide settings
that require a new deploy of the server to re-create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;rules&quot;:&lt;/code&gt; These are rules which are applied to every repo that Peril has access to. So in this case, every Pull Request in the org will make Peril run the Dangerfile at &lt;code&gt;&quot;artsy/artsy-danger@org/all-prs.ts&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;repos&quot;:&lt;/code&gt; These are repo-specific overrides, so a Pull Request to artsy/reaction would trigger both the org-wide Dangerfile, and one on the reaction repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;article class=&#39;post&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Events&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Dangerfile evaluation occurs once a GitHub webhook is sent. In the above examples there are two events that Danger supports:
&lt;code&gt;&quot;pull_request&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&quot;issues.opened&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. These are qualifiers that GitHub provide as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/events&quot;&gt;Webhook EventTypes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a lot of them: &lt;code&gt;commit_comment&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;deployment&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;deployment_status&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gollum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;installation&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;installation_repositories&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;issue_comment&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;issues&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;marketplace_purchase&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;member&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;membership&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;milestone&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;organization&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;org_block&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;page_build&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;project_card&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;project_column&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;project&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pull_request&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pull_request_review&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pull_request_review_comment&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;repository&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;team&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;team_add&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;watch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these events also have unique sub-actions too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an &lt;code&gt;issue&lt;/code&gt; event there is: &lt;code&gt;assigned&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unassigned&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;labeled&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unlabeled&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;opened&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;edited&lt;/code&gt;,  &lt;code&gt;milestoned&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;demilestoned&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;closed&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;reopened&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;code&gt;pull_request&lt;/code&gt; event there is: &lt;code&gt;assigned&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unassigned&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;review_requested&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;review_request_removed&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;labeled&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unlabeled&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;opened&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;edited&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;closed&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;reopened&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The way that you define rules in Peril gives you the ability to either focus on one action for an event type: &lt;code&gt;&quot;issues.opened&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or all actions
on an event: &lt;code&gt;&quot;pull_request&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Once you get your head around this, you start to get a sense of the scope of Peril. At Artsy, we&#39;ve barely scratched the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Growth&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Growth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve always advocated that Danger, and Peril should be &lt;a href=&quot;http://danger.systems/js/usage/culture.html&quot;&gt;applied incrementally&lt;/a&gt;. This applies even more when you&#39;re
making org changes that affect every developer - at least with Danger you can see the Pull Request that changes
the Dangerfile. With Peril you get none of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/artsy-danger/#rfcs&quot;&gt;an RFC process for Peril changes&lt;/a&gt;. There&#39;s not much to it, if you want to add a rule that
affects everyone then you need to make an issue following a template and then wait a week. If you make a new issue that
includes the title &lt;code&gt;RFC:&lt;/code&gt; then Peril sends a slack message to our developer Channel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/peril/peril-rfc.png&quot; alt=&quot;/images/peril/peril-rfc.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was simple to build via Peril, I first added the npm module: &lt;code&gt;&quot;@slack/client&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;&quot;modules&quot;&lt;/code&gt; array, making it available to a Dangerfile. Then I added an environment variable to Peril for a newly minted Slack Incoming Webhook URL, and exposed it to Dangerfiles via: &lt;code&gt;&quot;env_vars&quot;: [&quot;SLACK_RFC_WEBHOOK_URL&quot;]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I added a per-repo rule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;json&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;artsy/artsy-danger&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;issues.opened&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;artsy/artsy-danger@danger/new_rfc.ts&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This means the Dangerfile is only ran on &lt;code&gt;&quot;issues&quot;&lt;/code&gt; with an &lt;code&gt;&quot;opened&quot;&lt;/code&gt; action. I didn&#39;t want the discussion around a rule spamming our slack with webhooks from the other actions. The file &lt;code&gt;danger/new_rfc.ts&lt;/code&gt; looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Issues&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;github-webhook-event-types&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title_link&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;issue.html_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;author_icon&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;issue.user.avatar_url&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For events that are not a &lt;code&gt;&quot;pull_request&quot;&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;danger.github&lt;/code&gt; object is the JSON for the event.  You can get TypeScript types available for every GitHub event via the NPM module &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-webhook-event-types&quot;&gt;github-webhook-event-types&lt;/a&gt; which makes it much easier to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Where.to.go.from.here.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where to go from here?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/artsy-danger/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=is%3Aissue%20RFC&quot;&gt;a few RFCs&lt;/a&gt;, and I don&#39;t spend all day making Peril rules, I&#39;ve gotta &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=consignments%20&quot;&gt;do work y&#39;know&lt;/a&gt;. We&#39;re going to slowly build out our Peril infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m interested in exploring two ideas big for peril at the moment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a Peril plugin system looks like: You can include modules which can listen to events and react themselves. An org-wide spellcheck on markdown files could be as easy as including &lt;code&gt;&quot;modules&quot;: [&quot;peril-plugin-spellcheck&quot;]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danger/peril/issues/138&quot;&gt;scheduled jobs&lt;/a&gt; could look like for Peril: We have a bunch of checks I&#39;d like to make on a a regular occasion, and then passing back feedback via slack or making an issue on the repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt; For example if a repo has an owner who isn&#39;t in Artsy anymore, we should highlight that it needs a new owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in using Peril in large OSS projects, take a look at how Peril is used in CocoaPods via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CocoaPods/peril-settings&quot;&gt;CocoaPods/peril-settings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in using Peril in your org, run through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danger/peril/blob/master/docs/setup_for_org.md&quot;&gt;Setup for Org&lt;/a&gt; guide and help improve it when you inevitably have some weird issues.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Art + Feminism and Artsy Wikipedia/Wikidata Editathon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artsy has always had a focus on Art meets Science, and we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/CocoaPods-NYC/messages/boards/thread/50940969&quot;&gt;hosted a meet-up in July&lt;/a&gt; that really hits on both. We had a collection of Artsy Staff, members of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artandfeminism.org&quot;&gt;Art + Feminism&lt;/a&gt; NYC, the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/08/10/peer-lab/&quot;&gt;CocoaPods Peer Lab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artspracticum.org&quot;&gt;New York Arts Practicum&lt;/a&gt; and volunteers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://nyc.wikimedia.org/&quot;&gt;Wikimedia NYC&lt;/a&gt; all helping out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came with two aims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help anyone interested in contributing to Wikipedia get started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/categories&quot;&gt;The Art Genome Project&lt;/a&gt;(TAGP) to improve Wikidata entries for women Artists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I helped out with the second part, and the rest of this post will be about the lessons learned during this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon&quot;&gt;editathon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;What.is.Wikidata.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is Wikidata?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows Wikipedia, but fewer people know about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page&quot;&gt;Wikidata&lt;/a&gt;. We learned about it in the process of helping set up this meetup. Wikidata is a structured document store for generic items. The lexicon of keys that can go into a document are handled by community consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example let&#39;s take the artist: Ana Mendieta (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/artist/ana-mendieta&quot;&gt;artsy.net/artist/ana-mendieta&lt;/a&gt;) in (truncated) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/Q463639.json&quot;&gt;JSON representation&lt;/a&gt; inside Wikidata:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;[...]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The database is created with the the notion of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple&quot;&gt;semantic triples&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, which was new to us.
The idea being that each &lt;code&gt;Item&lt;/code&gt; (corresponding to a Q id (&lt;code&gt;Q463639&lt;/code&gt;)) has a bunch of associated &lt;code&gt;Statements&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;Properties&lt;/code&gt; in the form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;subject — predicate — object&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;this thing&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;has some relationship to&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;that thing&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Q463639&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;P27&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Q30&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In plain English…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ana Mendietta&lt;/strong&gt; has a &lt;strong&gt;country of citizenship&lt;/strong&gt; which is &lt;strong&gt;United States of America&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, a Wikidata &lt;code&gt;Item&lt;/code&gt; is just some structured data around a big bag of triples, like the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Artsy...Wikidata&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Artsy + Wikidata&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucky for this editathon, both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P2042&quot;&gt;Artsy Artist ID&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P2411&quot;&gt;TAGP ID&lt;/a&gt; were already inside the Wikidata controlled vocabulary of &lt;code&gt;Properties&lt;/code&gt;. This mean we could think about how to connect items rather than how we can pitch that is worth connecting them at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used Wikipedia to keep track of all &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/NYC/Artsy_ArtAndFeminism&quot;&gt;the useful links&lt;/a&gt; to share among contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the majority of us were new to the Wikidata, we scoped our projects to &quot;get something small done.&quot; We ended up with three projects on the Wikidata side:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit some wikidata items manually to understand the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand QuickStatements in order to do mass-updates of Wikidata items from Artsy data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore using pywikibot to ensure that updated Artsy details can be kept in sync with Wikidata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Outcomes&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Outcomes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got some changes to Wikidata. 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparing for this we also generated some data on Artists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bjIKKSHOxR2fJvLgf6yOwuDr3Iqo85hYMDMr4lL7Pxg/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Artsy Female and Nonbinary Emerging Artists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G_wCTrP4WzouxfmZdKzqcIKghJDJdiFrv4xQURxrsbI/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Artsy Female and Nonbinary Artists with &quot;Feminist Art&quot; and &quot;Contemporary Feminist&quot; Genes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These were generated back in July, so if you&#39;re looking for up-to-date data, we recommend using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.artsy.net/&quot;&gt;Artsy Developer API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Updating.Wikidata.with.data.from.Artsy&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Updating Wikidata with data from Artsy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending some time familiarizing ourselves with the process of manually creating and editing Items, we moved onto some basic &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-todo/quick_statements.php&quot;&gt;QuickStatement&lt;/a&gt; updates. QuickStatments are a simple text based interface for updating multiple items and properties at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up writing what would be the script for a single data item based on hardcoded values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day we were able to enter basic biographical facts from Artsy&#39;s CSVs into Wikidata in one fell swoop, by batching up several QuickStatement instructions. In the future, we could write an &quot;Artsy data to QuickStatement&quot; script to handle larger imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting aspects of looking through the data is that our Artists had a more nuanced set of gender identities than is currently available inside Wikidata&#39;s database. We found that we didn&#39;t have enough time to address this, but as Wikidata is an on-going project, anyone can add this in the future. If you&#39;re looking for a good first foray into Wikidata - this will improve the foundations for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Using.pywikibot.to.update.Wikidata&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Using pywikibot to update Wikidata&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Pywikibot_-_Python_3_Tutorial&quot;&gt;PAWS&lt;/a&gt; Python script that would take metadata from the CSVs Artsy provided on Genes and added that data to existing Wikidata documents. You can get our bot &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orta/artsy-wikidata-bot&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the work is inside a Jupyter Notebook, which you can get a full preview of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orta/artsy-wikidata-bot/blob/master/Artsy%2BGenes%2Bto%2BWikiData.ipynb&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/editathon/jupyternotebook.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We loved the idea of having code showing the incremental process as it&#39;s being eval&#39;d. We got the bot to a point where it could edit a Wikidata item based on it data exported from Artsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan to keep an eye on future efforts to coordinate Wikidata bot development, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SuLab/WikidataIntegrator&quot;&gt;WikidataIntegrator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Upcoming.ideas&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Upcoming ideas&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed what Artsy can do next, we have an idea of how we can connect our data to confirmed data on Wikidata by keeping the Wikidata QID inside our databases too. This means that we can safely keep that up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would love to do this again, it was exciting to have the project introduced to us - and we really get what they&#39;re trying to do. We want to host another, and you should come if you&#39;re in NYC!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in exploring the Artsy Genome database, we recently updated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/categories&quot;&gt;The Art Genome Project&#39;s Genes and Definitions&lt;/a&gt; with all of our genes as a CSV under &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&quot;&gt;CC-A&lt;/a&gt;. We&#39;d love to know if you find any interesting uses.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making Artsy Editorial Accessible</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During Artsy&#39;s recent 2017 Hackathon we tackled making all of our editorial content &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility&quot;&gt;accessible&lt;/a&gt;. The idea was hatched at  Berlin JSConf this spring, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/H4FzW9oFObs&quot;&gt;Laura Carvajal gave a talk&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&#39; experience implementing better accessibility requirements, and how they built these considerations into their testing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does accessibility mean in a browser? Generally the term refers to supporting the wide range of assistive technologies for users with vision or motor impairments. These include screen readers, as well as mouseless navigation using a keyboard, eye tracking and other devices. Interestingly these technologies are implemented at the OS level rather than the browser itself. Mac&#39;s OS includes a built in screen-reader, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS&quot;&gt;JAWS&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular application in this vein. It is also notable that browsers do not track users who employ assistive tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two users on &lt;a href=&quot;http://webaim.org/discussion/mail_thread?thread=6326&quot;&gt;WebAIM&#39;s forum&lt;/a&gt; excellently present the case for accessibility as a developer&#39;s responsibility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Users may be highly resistant to having their disabilities identified as they go throughout the web. Most persons with disabilities would really just rather that &lt;em&gt;the Web just work&lt;/em&gt; for them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Looking at accessibility as a way to serve a specific population is missing the point that accessibility is about inclusion of all people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central tenant of Artsy&#39;s mission is to &#39;make art as accessible as music&#39;. By expanding accessibility for the visually and motor impaired to writing on art and culture, this projects allows us to follow through on this statement in a very literal way. Furthermore, there&#39;s no reason to ignore this audience; accommodating use of assistive technologies is an ethically responsible thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Putting.it.into.practice&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Putting it into practice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smartly structured HTML is essential for screen readers. They take note of semantic elements like headings or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and interpret our page&#39;s elements in the order they are written. Absolute and fixed spacing are ignored in this context, so it is important to realize non-visual reading of your site may prioritize different information, or present it in a different order than expected. This means that in JavaScript-oriented environments, and anywhere elements are inserted on the client, it is important to keep all elements necessary to navigating available in a semantic form at all times, including drop downs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used three tools to evaluate pain points on our site: the npm module &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y&quot;&gt;pa11y&lt;/a&gt;, Chrome&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon&quot;&gt;Accessibility Developer Tools&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wave.webaim.org/&quot;&gt;WAVE&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash; a web accessibility evaluation tool by &lt;a href=&quot;http://webaim.org/&quot;&gt;WebAIM&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit dedicated to &quot;empowering organizations to make their own content accessible&quot;.  All three work similarly. Input a web address, and an error report is generated. Pa11y works in the terminal, and can export to a CSV, and even create a dashboard tracking separate URLs. Chrome handily provides a color-coded scorecard in addition to an accessibility audit report. Because Chrome&#39;s reporting lives in the browser&#39;s console, it is especially easy to inspect your code directly from an error. However, each tool brought up unique issues, so it is prudent to try a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a range of warnings and errors on our first run, where Chrome gave us a failing grade of 62, and pa11y raked up 48 errors, not counting a sizeable number of warnings. Luckily, most of the changes were fast and easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use meta language property (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase the meta property for maximum scale to 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add hidden text to icon-only links and UI elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add alt text to all images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include aria form attributes on input fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use semantic roles for the article body (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div role=&#39;article&#39;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove of duplicate IDs from pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove vendor-generated ids from SVGs, which in our case were often duplicates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A summary of changes implemented can be seen in pull requests &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/force/pull/1730&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/force/pull/1732&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were several places on our site where we wanted to include text that was intended only for screen readers. However, &lt;code&gt;display: none&lt;/code&gt; is not necessarily acceptable in this context. Instead we opted for absolute positing of screen-reader targeted elements far out of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;css&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;hides&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;screen-readers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.screen-reader-text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;10000px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A few challenges were encountered as we worked through the error reports. My research brought up mixed messages on &lt;code&gt;display: none&lt;/code&gt;. For example, Artsy renders the main menu in both desktop and mobile versions, but hides one view based on the user agent. We saw errors with all testing frameworks for having duplicate IDs, despite the fact that these elements were hidden via &lt;code&gt;display: none&lt;/code&gt;.  This is a problem that would be well solved with React, where we could render content based to screen width rather than hiding a duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017-08-29-Making-Artsy-Editorial-Accessible/Chrome-Accessibility-Dashboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome Accessibility Audit Score&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another road block encountered was for headers that contain links&amp;mdash; which the error reports recognized as empty headers, rather than reading the link. We use linked headings frequently for section titles in our articles, so this is an issue we are still mitigating. Lastly, using a screen reader is a skill set all its own! While our Chrome audit score is now far higher than where we started, my own experience using a screen reader proved far more difficult than expected. To be completely sure our implementation is working, I hope to find an experienced screen-reader user to give it a spin.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deploying your app on a weekly basis via fastlane + Travis CI</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We have a few apps now, but one of them isn&#39;t really used by anyone other than developers. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission/tree/master/Example&quot;&gt;our React Native host app&lt;/a&gt;. We built our React Native components &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/08/24/On-Emission/&quot;&gt;as a library&lt;/a&gt; to be consumed by our other apps. Our development environment for these components is a unique app that acts as a host for the React Native components. It&#39;s effectively a long tableview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app is often updated for developers, but never deployed to beta users inside Artsy. So I automated it. Using Travis CI and fastlane. This post covers how I got that set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;




&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fastlane-weekly/screenshot.png&quot; width=300&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As the JavaScript is continuously deployed, the native side of the app rarely gets a deploy. In order to ensure an up-to-date version of the app, I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cron-jobs/&quot;&gt;scheduler&lt;/a&gt; now available in Travis CI, and Circle CI. This is a perfect use-case for one-off tasks like uploading an app to Apple&#39;s Testflight on a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted this to exist outside of our current CI environment for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our CI is already &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission/pull/263&quot;&gt;using AppHub&lt;/a&gt; to deploy the JavaScript parts of our React Native on a per-commit basis. It&#39;s complicated enough as it is, without adding a lot more process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our CI is currently running on Linux boxes, and so everything is fast and stable. Deploying using the main repo would force us to use macOS which would slow down our processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The downside of this choice is that the process of uploading is not inside the main repo, and can go out of sync with the main app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Setup&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a new repo, and added the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission-nebula/commit/4d18a11629e097c71b9a375465c754abf45f62d6&quot;&gt;usual LICENSE and README&lt;/a&gt;, then started &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission-nebula/pull/1&quot;&gt;working on a PR&lt;/a&gt; that added the initial support for CI to run. Here are the general steps I needed to make work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloading and setting up the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring signing will work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating the build and shipping it to Testflight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notifications that it passed or succeeded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally I needed to document the process, which is what you&#39;re reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Downloading.and.setting.up.the.application&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Downloading and setting up the application&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial thoughts were to use a submodule, but that option provides little advantage over cloning the repo itself so it&#39;s done inline. Our dependencies for the app live in Rubygems (fastlane/CocoaPods), NPM (React Native) and CocoaPods (Artsy Mobile code), so I use the &lt;code&gt;before_install&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;before_script&lt;/code&gt; section of the &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; to set up our dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;yaml&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Use a Mac build please&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;objective-c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;osx_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;xcode8.2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Ensure that fastlane is at the latest version&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;before_install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;bundle update&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Let fastlane set up the other dependency managers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;before_script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;bundle exec fastlane setup&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Separate fastlane lanes so that they can be individually&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# tested one by one during development&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;bundle exec fastlane validate_env_vars&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;bundle exec fastlane ci_deploy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note the &lt;code&gt;- bundle update&lt;/code&gt;. As fastlane works against unofficial iTunes connect which is always changing, it&#39;s safer to always use the most recent release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Ensuring.signing.will.work.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ensuring signing will work.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is a bit tricker, luckily I&#39;ve already set up one of our apps to use &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/04/05/what-is-fastlane-match/&quot;&gt;fastlane match&lt;/a&gt; and I can re-use that infrastructure. As it is a private repo, Travis did not have access to clone the repo. I fixed this by creating an access token for a user with read-only access to our match-codesigning repo, then exposed this as a private environment variable in CI which the Matchfile uses. E.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;ruby&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;git_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;https://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;GITHUB_SUBMODULES_USER&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;@github.com/artsy/mobile_fastlane_match&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Instead of &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# git_url &amp;quot;https://github.com/artsy/mobile_fastlane_match&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is one of the highlights on fastlane&#39;s choice in building a DSL that which sits above a real programming language, you give users a lot of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, I added a fastlane lane for code signing, and keychain setup. This just calls two setup functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;ruby&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lane&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:setup_signing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;setup_travis&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;appstore&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Creating.the.build.and.shipping.it.to.Testflight&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating the build and shipping it to Testflight&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is handled by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/gym&quot;&gt;fastlane gym&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the main lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;ruby&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# The main job for fastlane in this repo, you can run this on your computer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# You can run it via `bundle exec fastlane ship`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lane&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:ship&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# We were having issues with building an a few folders deep.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# The /Pods bit is because we can rely on it being there, see&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# this link: https://docs.fastlane.tools/advanced/#directory-behavior&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;chdir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;../emission/Example/Pods&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gym&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;workspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Emission.xcworkspace&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Deploy&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Emission&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# [...]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It uses a scheme for deploys, which prioritises using AppHub over a local React Native server. Gym handles a lot of CLI ugliness for us, and works well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sending the app to Testflight involves a a few lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;ruby&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Get the last 10 lines of the CHANGELOG for Testflight&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;../emission/CHANGELOG.md&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;upcoming_release_notes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;### &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Ship to testflight&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pilot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;upcoming_release_notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This lets the deploy process figure out what the latest release version is, and how many builds have shipped for that version. Then those can be used to set the build version and create a tag associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/pilot&quot;&gt;fastlane pilot&lt;/a&gt; is used to send off the compiled build to Testflight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Keeping.track.of.deploys&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keeping track of deploys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know when we&#39;ll need it today, but it&#39;s always good to be able to go back and see what code lines up to every release. To do this I have a few lines of Ruby that creates a tag inside the original Emission repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Notifications.that.it.passed.or.succeeded.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notifications that it passed or succeeded.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was easy, I created a new slack inbound web-hook and added that as an environment variable. Then when a build passes we post a notification that there is a new version for everyone in Slack, if the lane fails then it will also post to slack. To ensure we keep on top of it, during development this was commented out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;ruby&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# If the weekly task fails, then ship a message&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;slack&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Error Deploying Emission: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;         &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;         &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;Output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to_s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That wraps up setting up the CI. Once you&#39;ve confirmed everything has worked, you can add the scheduler inside Travis and expect to see a slack notification in a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the process, our &lt;code&gt;Fastfile&lt;/code&gt; looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;slack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Error Deploying Emission: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;Output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to_s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Automatically deploying is a good pattern for encouraging more deploys of an app which has only been deployed once. It&#39;s a pattern we could also move to in some of our other apps too, if it feels good. If you&#39;re interested in if something has changed since this post was authored, the repo is here: https://github.com/artsy/emission-nebula so you can read out the Fastfile and we&#39;ll answer questions you have inside GitHub issues on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most annoying part about building deployment changes are that an iteration takes ~20 minutes, so make sure you also have another (easily interrupted) task to do at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second most annoying is that it took months to eventually get this right - so I owe Felix Krause a big thanks for sitting down and pairing with me, we figuring out that &lt;code&gt;xcodebuild&lt;/code&gt; can create empty archive issues when you run projects that have the xcproject/xcworkspace a few levels deep.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Artsy API Ready for Production Non-Commercial Use</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;About 3 years ago, dB. announced that Artsy &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/09/12/designing-the-public-artsy-api/&quot;&gt;had a public API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Artsy API currently provides access to images of historic artwork and related information on &lt;a href=&quot;https://artsy.net&quot;&gt;artsy.net&lt;/a&gt; for educational and other non-commercial purposes. You can try it for playing, testing, and learning, but not yet for production. The scope of the API will expand in the future as it gains some traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve wrapped up some legal work around the developer API terms and services, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/doppler/pull/119&quot;&gt;the PR is here&lt;/a&gt; and I&#39;m happy to announce that the API is ready for non-commercial production use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;TDLR&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.artsy.net/terms&quot;&gt;Terms and Conditions&lt;/a&gt; today for using the Artsy API is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-commercial use only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You only get access to public-domain artworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The API:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://robots.thoughtbot.com/writing-a-hypermedia-api-client-in-ruby&quot;&gt;Hypermedia&lt;/a&gt; API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covers &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.artsy.net/docs/artists&quot;&gt;Artists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.artsy.net/docs/artworks&quot;&gt;Artworks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.artsy.net/docs/genes&quot;&gt;Genes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.artsy.net/docs/shows&quot;&gt;Shows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.artsy.net/docs/partners&quot;&gt;Partners&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.artsy.net/docs/&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you have a great idea for an app that can use public-domain data, then the Artsy API is the right place to look: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.artsy.net/&quot;&gt;https://developers.artsy.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using GitHub Issues for Blog Comments</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve worked on a few large-scale OSS projects, and I believe that people find it easier to just leave a comment and rely on a contributor to explain a problem rather than consulting the documentation. I consider doing everything you can to make people find their own answers a strong part of &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/07/03/handling-big-projects/&quot;&gt;defensive open source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the posts I write, I have an even lower tolerance for comments. For example, I added the ability to turn off comments per-post and haven&#39;t allowed comments on any posts I&#39;ve written here. A lot of transitory discussion around an article happens on twitter via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ArtsyOpenSource/&quot;&gt;@ArtsyOpenSource&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m willing to give it another shot though, and so I got around to creating a simple system for allowing opt-in comments on posts using GitHub Issues. The rest of this post will be about how you can do it also, and a bit about why I think GitHub Issues are a happy medium for the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;




&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment-header&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;comment-username&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/orta&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://avatars6.githubusercontent.com/u/49038?v=4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;40&quot; height=&quot;40&quot;&gt;orta&lt;/a&gt; commented &lt;a class=&quot;comment-date&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/artsy.github.io/issues/355#issuecomment-313158506&quot;&gt;2 days ago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments can be worth a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a static site like ours it can be a bit tricky, but with an external server and some simple JavaScript it can work out &lt;g-emoji alias=&quot;+1&quot; fallback-src=&quot;https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png&quot; ios-version=&quot;6.0&quot;&gt;👍&lt;/g-emoji&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Getting.set.up&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Getting set up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general concept is that you have some JavaScript in your page which requests a list of comments from GitHub. These are available as a JSON API, you can grab that then style the results. Sounds easy right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out to be a bit more complicated. GitHub&#39;s API has rate-limits for IP addresses, and they&#39;re reasonably low. So, you&#39;ll want to use authenticated requests, but you don&#39;t really want to include your access tokens inside the JavaScript on your blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve worked around this with a project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orta/gh-commentify&quot;&gt;gh-commentify&lt;/a&gt;, a node app whose job is to wrap your comment API requests with an access token. You can create your own instance on heroku using &lt;a href=&quot;https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/orta/gh-commentify&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. It gets scoped to a single org/user, so you can avoid others using your heroku instance for their blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there you need to be able to declare in a post what issue it is hooked up to. This blog uses Jekyll, which has &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/&quot;&gt;YAML Front Matter&lt;/a&gt; on posts. So, I edited our post templates to look for a key &lt;code&gt;comment_id&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there you need to grab the comments JSON, and move them into the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I based my work on these two posts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html&quot;&gt;GitHub hosted comments for GitHub hosted blogs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://donw.io/post/github-comments/&quot;&gt;Replacing Disqus with Github Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However this version is more reliable (GitHub authenticated requests) and has fewer dependencies (no jQuery for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;html&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;{% if page.comment_id %}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;article&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;post&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    {% include gh_comments.html %}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;{% endif %}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This then imports the required JavaScript into the page. It feels a lot like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;37&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;38&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;41&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#39;javascript&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;writeToComment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No-one is going to award this JavaScript with a prize for elegance, but it works just fine. That&#39;s basically it, you can edit the DOM however you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full PR for these changes is here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/artsy.github.io/pull/363&quot;&gt;artsy.github.io#363&lt;/a&gt; - and you can see the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/artsy.github.io/blob/source/_includes/gh_comments.html&quot;&gt;HTML/JS here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Styling&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Styling&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The style of our comments are built to evoke the GitHub UI for issues. This is done to prime people for a relatively different type of comment creation, but still feel like it&#39;s a part of the Artsy OSS style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/comments-are-on/example-comment.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment-header&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;comment-username&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/orta&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://avatars6.githubusercontent.com/u/49038?v=4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;40&quot; height=&quot;40&quot;&gt;orta&lt;/a&gt; commented &lt;a class=&quot;comment-date&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/artsy.github.io/issues/355#issuecomment-313158506&quot;&gt;10 days ago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is done and dusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Why.GitHub.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why GitHub?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s easier for you to keep track of the conversations, you&#39;re likely already having a lot of conversations in a place like GitHub. This means you can use the same flow and tools as your daily job, not relying on a third party service&#39;s emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have good admin tools: you can edit comments, block and report problematic users. These are tools that you have for all repos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People will be using their developer accounts, which I&#39;d like to hope they will take pride in. You&#39;re probably more likely to get high quality responses. The lack of threading is a bit of a shame in this context, but we&#39;ve lived with it in GitHub Issues for this long, so I&#39;m OK with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This setup makes it trivial to drop comments from the blog anytime, and you still have all the comments around in a constructive way after. We don&#39;t have to hope that other services have export features and open data. Everything public is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/2298-github-data-ready-for-you-to-explore-with-bigquery&quot;&gt;open data&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So: low maintenance, works on static sites, data isn&#39;t silo-ed and it&#39;s more likely to result in positive interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Intro to React Native for an iOS Developer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;React Native is a new native library that vastly changes the way in which you can create applications. The majority of the information and tutorials on the subject come from the angle of &lt;em&gt;&quot;you are a web developer, and want to do native&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes sense, given that the size of the JavaScript/web audience is much bigger than native developers, and far more open in the idea of writing apps using JavaScript. For web developers it opens a new creative space to work, however for native developers it provides a way to work with different tools on the same problem. Considering that most developers with a few years on the platform will be comfortable with the Xcode toolset, recommending a change this drastic is a tough sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been using React Native now for about a year and a half, and have started to slow down on sweeping changes inside the codebase. This is great because it means we&#39;re spending less time trying to get things to work, and more time building on top of a solid foundations. Now that we&#39;re settled, it&#39;s time to start deeply understanding what happens with React Native.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like cover a lot of the common questions we get asked about from the perspective of native developers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is React Native?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you use React Native?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When is React Native a good technology choice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This article covers an awful lot, so free up at least 45 minutes, make a tea and then come back to this on your computer. It&#39;s worth your time if you&#39;re interested in all the hype around React Native.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;




&lt;div class=&quot;mobile-only&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Before you get started&lt;/strong&gt;, it looks like you&#39;re using a really small screen, this post is built for larger screens and having a terminal around will make it much easier to understand the ideas inside the post. &lt;strong&gt;So if you can, please switch to a different device.&lt;/strong&gt; You will be missing sections otherwise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the highest level, React Native is a way to write React apps that run as native programs. You write your app&#39;s code in JavaScript, and React Native bridges that code with native UIView elements. React Native has two stated aims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn Once, Write Anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a native developer experience as fast as the web developer&#39;s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Learn Once, Write Anywhere&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; is a play on Java&#39;s &lt;em&gt;&quot;Write Once, Run Anywhere&quot;&lt;/em&gt; - something that has not worked well for user-interface heavy mobile clients. The idea of running the same code everywhere encourages platform-less APIs which water down the positives of each platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Learn once&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; in this context means that you can re-use the same ideas and tools across many platforms. You don&#39;t lose your ability to write the same user experiences as you can with native code, but you can re-use your existing skills across different platforms. That is the &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Write Anywhere&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React Native makes it feasible to share a lot of code between iOS, Android and Web. It is not a panacea for making a cross-platform app though; cross-platform is not an &lt;em&gt;explicit&lt;/em&gt; goal of the project. The project moves towards making the best per-platform apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a developer experience &lt;strong&gt;as fast as the web developer&#39;s&lt;/strong&gt; you need to really reflect on how slow native development is. A change in one part of the app required a full restart of the simulator, and for the developer to get back into the same position to see the changes. As a web developer you would just refresh the browser. For example with the simplest Xcode iOS app template, I made a single line change and did an incremental rebuild and it took 9 seconds to get me back into my app with the new change, on a 2015 MacBook Pro. 9 seconds per change leaves a lot of time to lose focus, and discourages playfulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If those are the stated goals of React Native specifically, what are the goals of React?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;React&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;React&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React provides a single-direction Component model that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; handle what is traditionally handled by the MVC paradigm. The library was created originally for the web, where updates at the equivalent of &lt;code&gt;UIView&lt;/code&gt; level are considered slow. React provides a diffing engine for a tree of components that would &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; be represented as HTML, allowing you to write the end-state of your interface and React would apply the difference to only the HTML that changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React was built out of a desire to abstract away a web page&#39;s true view hierarchy (called the DOM) so that they could make changes to all of their views and then React would handle finding the differences between view states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern is applied by providing a consistent way to represent a component&#39;s state. Imagine if every &lt;code&gt;UIView&lt;/code&gt; subclass had a &quot;&lt;code&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt;&quot; function where you can send a subset of all available options (backgroundColor, frame, alpha, etc) and then eventually UIKit would re-concile all changes to all views in batches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of what this feels like, I&#39;ve created a simplified version of the React components for one of the screens in our app, the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/e4bbde386d54bc8ca73565d667e2701ab0fad0f0/src/lib/Components/Consignments/Components/ArtistSearchResults.tsx&quot;&gt;full implementation is here&lt;/a&gt;. You can see the original design, a prototype of how that is then split into components, then the tree strucutre for those components and finally the props for each component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Re-use our existing search TextInput component&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Exports a React component called Search Results from this file&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ScrollView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rowForResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;/ScrollView&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;/View&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Returns a single component for a row in the search&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rowForResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ArtistResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;uri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;/Text&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;/ArtistResult&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// A function to handle changes to the search query&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onQueryChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re looking at a subclass of &lt;code&gt;React.Component&lt;/code&gt; with two functions, &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rowForResult&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; is the key function for defining your tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of MVC, React uses composition of components to handle complexity - this should feel quite similar to iOS development. The screen of an iOS app is typically made up of &lt;code&gt;UIView&lt;/code&gt;s, and &lt;code&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt;s which exist as 2 interlinked trees of hierarchy. A &lt;code&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; itself doesn&#39;t have a visual representation, but exists to manipulate data, handle actions and the view structure for &lt;code&gt;UIViews&lt;/code&gt; who do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By merging the responsibilities of a &lt;code&gt;UIView&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; into a Component, there is a consistent way to work with all aspects of your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try to undestand this, let&#39;s take a trivial example. Downloading some data from the network and showing it on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In UIKit-world you would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; subclass, which makes the API request on its &lt;code&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the request is sent you present a set of views during loading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the API request has returned, you convert the data into native model objects, remove the loading screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You then create a new view hierarchy for your model, and pass down attributes of the model to those views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In React you would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;React.Component&lt;/code&gt; subclass, which makes the API request on its &lt;code&gt;onMount&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the request is sent you render a set of components during loading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the API request has returned, you change your &quot;state&quot; on the main component with the API request&#39;s JSON&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The state change re-runs your render method, which passes the API &quot;state&quot; down to the component for your page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They are conceptually very similar. React does two key things differently: Handle &quot;state&quot; changes on any component, and handle view creation/addition and removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Handling..State..Changes&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Handling &quot;State&quot; Changes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&#39;ve been quoting &quot;state&quot;, I should explain this. There are two types of &quot;state&quot; inside React, and I&#39;ve been using the quoted term to refer to both for simplicity till now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of data that control a component: &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; are set by the parent and they are fixed throughout the lifetime of a component. For data that is going to change, we have to use &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/state.html&quot;&gt;React Native - State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in our case above, getting the API results only changes the state on the component which makes the request. However, the results are passed down into the props &lt;em&gt;(properties)&lt;/em&gt; of the component&#39;s children as any further changes to the API data (for example if you were polling for updates) would result in a re-render of the child-components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the lifetime of that top-level component, the changes due to the API request are put in state. Then the results are passed down to its children as props. This means the children can potentially change when an API response is received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a hard abstraction to grok outright, so it&#39;s good to take a second opinion. I felt that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/arjunsk/react-guide/blob/3bde47efae5dd8e238d0e8176083bd6d1ca03bb3/props-vs-state.md#props-vs-state&quot;&gt;this guide from uberVU&lt;/a&gt; as well as the official docs above explain it in different ways. Which can help ground your understanding. Overall, these are the rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt; &lt;em&gt;props&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt; &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Can get initial value from parent Component? &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Yes &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Can be changed by parent Component? &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Yes &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Can set default values inside Component? &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Yes &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Can change inside Component? &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; No &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Can set initial value for child Components? &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Yes &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Can change in child Components? &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Yes &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uberVU/react-guide&quot;&gt;uberVU&#39;s react-guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Handling.View.Management&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Handling View Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the consolidated rules around state management React can quite easily know when there have been changes throughout your component tree and to call &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; for those components. &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; is the function where you declare the tree of children for a component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flow [of data] in React is one-directional. We maintain a hierarchy of components, in which each component depends only on its parent and its own internal state. We do this with properties: data is passed from a parent to its children in a top-down manner. If an ancestor component relies on the state of its descendant, one should pass down a callback to be used by the descendant to update the ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/communication-ios.html&quot;&gt;React Native - Communication between native and React Native&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Props are treated as the equivalent of a Swift &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; variable in this case, any changes to props require a new version of the component to exist in the tree and thus &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; is called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in summary: React&#39;s paradigm is a component tree, where the &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; function of a component passes down one component&#39;s state into the props of the children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;React.Native&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;React Native&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React was built for the web - but &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/KVZ-P-ZI6W4?t=12m54s&quot;&gt;some-one realised&lt;/a&gt; that they could de-couple the React component tree from the HTML output, and instead that could be a tree of &lt;code&gt;UIView&lt;/code&gt;&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the core idea of React Native. Bridge the React component tree to native primitives. React Native runs on a lot of platforms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Officially: iOS, Android, tvOS &amp;amp; VR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unofficially: macOS, Windows &amp;amp; Ubuntu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Each of these platforms will have their own way of showing some text e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;RCTText&lt;/code&gt; for iOS and tvOS - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/559805d0b04da99b80a0813917b7eaa2716faa4c/Libraries/Text/RCTText.m#L117&quot;&gt;which uses NSTextStorage, and drawRect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Textfield&lt;/code&gt; for Android - which uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/559805d0b04da99b80a0813917b7eaa2716faa4c/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/flat/DrawTextLayout.java&quot;&gt;Canvas and a DrawCommand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Three.js view primitive&lt;/code&gt; for VR - which uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react-vr/blob/1f037c118b2088f7881c240fdfd6c204de8b2c65/OVRUI/src/UIView/UIView.js#L221&quot;&gt;BitmapFontGeometry&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react-vr/blob/master/OVRUI/src/SDFFont/SDFFont.js&quot;&gt;Shaders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;RCTText&lt;/code&gt; for macOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-macos/blob/f3ce1d124e32a95e48ed26c05865e150714887da/Libraries/Text/RCTText.m#L182&quot;&gt;which also uses NSTextStorage, and drawRect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ReactTextShadowNode&lt;/code&gt; for Windows - which uses a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-windows/blob/2cc697859c80f59350e9613565a975023ae1046e/ReactWindows/ReactNative/Views/Text/ReactTextShadowNode.cs#L252&quot;&gt;RichTextBlock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;QQuickItem&lt;/code&gt; for Ubuntu - Which uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/react-native/blob/98e0ce38cdcb8c489a064c436a353be754e95f89/ReactUbuntu/runtime/src/reactrawtextmanager.cpp#L84&quot;&gt;QString to render&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But when working at React-level, you would use the component &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;. This means you work at a &quot;React in JS&quot; level, and rely on the primitives provided by each implementation of React Native.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For iOS, this works by using a JavaScript runtime (running via JavaScriptCore in your app) which sends &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nicklockwood/status/876130867177033730&quot;&gt;messages across a bridge&lt;/a&gt; that handles the native &lt;code&gt;UIView&lt;/code&gt; hierarchy. Most of the messaging work is handled inside the &lt;code&gt;RCTUIManager&lt;/code&gt; which receives calls like &lt;code&gt;createView:viewName:rootTag:props:&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;setChildren:reactTags:&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;updateView:viewName:props:&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;createAnimatedNode:config&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bridging is how you get a lot of the positive aspects of working with the JavaScript tooling ecosystem. The JavaScript used by React can be updated independent of the app, but so long as it is working with the same native bridge version. This bridging technique is how React can safely have a reliable version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnholdsworth.com/injection.html?index=438&quot;&gt;Injection for Xcode&lt;/a&gt;. It re-evaluates your JavaScript code, and that triggers a new set of messages to the native side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any cross-platform abstraction, React Native can be leaky. To write a cross-platform app that purely lives inside JS Runtime, you have to write React-only code. React and React Native doesn&#39;t have ways to handle primitives like &lt;code&gt;UINavigationController&lt;/code&gt; - they want your entire app to be represented as a series of components that can be mapped across many platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t optimal when you&#39;re coming in from the native world - where you&#39;re used to building platform-specific experiences, and are genuinely excited at the prospect of platform-specific APIs. Generally you can look for other teams who have felt the same and are willing to write native-bridged code that&#39;s specific to iOS. Shout-out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=wix+engineering&amp;amp;t=osx&amp;amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Wix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/tagged/mobile&quot;&gt;AirBnB&lt;/a&gt; who are doing great work in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a critical problem against React Native? I don&#39;t think so, we&#39;ve added native abstractions where it was the right decision and we&#39;ve used JavaScript when it was the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, our &lt;code&gt;Image&lt;/code&gt; component is a bridged native component that uses &lt;code&gt;SDWebImage&lt;/code&gt; under the hood so that we can share an image cache for thumbnails with the native side of the app. It works by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is a commit that initially added &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission/commit/a404ccf1519ec79fc0bfadf6e572d990caa0a9ec&quot;&gt;the native component&lt;/a&gt;, before it became more complex from production usage. The bridging macros cannot be used in Swift, but you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios.html#exporting-swift&quot;&gt;still bridge to existing Swift code&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fundamentally means you can have both: a faster more elegant way to write your interfaces and the ability to still work with any part of the native toolchains you want. You can pick based on the problem, and the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Ten.minutes.to.try.out.React&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ten minutes to try out React&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, no joke, don&#39;t skip this bit, you try React Native right now. This will require some terminal skills, and about 5 minutes, it shouldn&#39;t be more complex than using CocoaPods via the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;desktop-only&quot; style=&#39;display: flex; flex-flow:row;&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#39;flex:1; display: block;&#39;&gt;

&lt;div class=&#39;bogus-wrapper&#39;&gt;&lt;notextile&gt;&lt;figure class=&#39;code&#39;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# see https://brew.sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Install the JavaScript tools you&amp;#39;ll need&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;brew install nodejs yarn
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# You&amp;#39;ll want Visual Studio Code to work on this&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;brew cask install visual-studio-code
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Install the React Native CLI&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;yarn global add react-native-cli
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Create a new React Native&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# project called TrendingArtists&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;line&#39;&gt;react-native init TrendingArtists
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id=&#39;installing-node&#39; class=&quot;desktop-only&quot; style=&#39;flex:1; display: block;&#39;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll need &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; installed globally so you can run JavaScript and handle dependency management respectively.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For working inside a JavaScript project, I&#39;d strongly recommend using Microsoft&#39;s &lt;a href=&#39;https://code.visualstudio.com&#39;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;, it does a great job for React Native.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up we&#39;re going to make the initial project and look around, so once all the installing has finished. You can follow along with the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the command `react-native` isn&#39;t working, &lt;a href=&#39;https://github.com/keitaito&#39;&gt;@keitaito&lt;/a&gt; has some useful advice in the [comments](#comments).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;article class=&#39;post&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so that should do a lot of downloading, and you&#39;ll have a new folder with a fully set up project for iOS and Android. We&#39;ll be focusing on the iOS side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open up &lt;code&gt;TrendingArtists&lt;/code&gt; in your editor and inside your terminal with &lt;code&gt;cd TrendingArtists&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;code .&lt;/code&gt;. From the terminal you can get the Xcode project compiled, and your new app open inside the iOS simulator with &lt;code&gt;react-native run-ios&lt;/code&gt;. This will will set you up to work without Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;run-ios&lt;/code&gt; command first uses &lt;code&gt;xcodebuild&lt;/code&gt; to compile the native app found in &lt;code&gt;ios/TrendingArtists.xcodeproj&lt;/code&gt; it will then load up the the React Native Packager. We&#39;ll cover that later, for now, think of it as a JavaScript file change watcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a simulator has popped up, you&#39;ll see the &quot;Welcome to React Native&quot; screen. Now that we&#39;ve got &quot;an app&quot; running. It will take a minute or two to parse all your JavaScript. So then let&#39;s take a moment to look through what we have in our file system now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;desktop-only&quot; style=&#39;display: flex; flex-flow: row;&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;desktop-only&quot; style=&#39;flex:1; display: block;&#39;&gt;

&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#39;line-number&#39;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/notextile&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;desktop-only&quot; style=&#39;flex:1; display: block;&#39;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are we looking at?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up - we have some test files, these files are unique per platform - though they do have the same code right now. In React Native imports can resolve to be different per-platform, which is why you see &lt;code&gt;.android.js&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.ios.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;index.android.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;index.ios.js&lt;/code&gt;  are the launching point for this app, so it&#39;s in there you&#39;ll find the code for what we&#39;re seeing on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;ios&lt;/code&gt; folder, we have the native side of React Native. Looks pretty empty from here, but when you open the workspace you&#39;ll note that it is referring to a lot of &lt;code&gt;xcproject&lt;/code&gt;s which are inside your &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Xcode project is really barebones, it&#39;s just an &lt;code&gt;AppDelegate&lt;/code&gt; that creates a &lt;code&gt;UIView&lt;/code&gt; subclass. You can see that it references &lt;code&gt;index.ios.js&lt;/code&gt; which is where your JavaScript side starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you have the &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; which is like an Xcodeproj + Podfile in one, and the &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder. This file houses all your JavaScript dependencies, your runtime scripts and app metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;article class=&#39;post&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to show you how to make a change appear instantly. In your iOS Simulator, perform a shake gesture (&lt;code&gt;cmd + ctrl + z&lt;/code&gt;) and in the React Native debug menu, hit &quot;Enable Hot Reloading&quot;. It will trigger a reload of all your JS code again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can go into your text editor and change some of the words inside &lt;code&gt;index.ios.js&lt;/code&gt; - those changes will be reflected almost instantly. You can do this for almost anything, almost anywhere. We&#39;ve been working &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission/&quot;&gt;on Emission&lt;/a&gt; for over a year, and this is still close to instant in every part of the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key changes here is that React Native will occasionally make you wait a bit longer (parsing all of the JavaScript) in exchange for very often giving you sub-second changes reflected on screen. This is an incredibly positive change from 9 seconds per iteration from my blank native app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This substantially changes how easily I can focus on my work in React Native, and how effortlessly I can experiment with code. It makes me feel really productive, and makes pairing a joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;d like to go through a tutorial from this point, I&#39;d recommend these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html&quot;&gt;The React Native site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re now going back to talking about the hows and whys. Good luck with those tutorials though - &lt;a href=&quot;/images/what-is-rn/you-have-got-this.gif&quot;&gt;you&#39;ve got this :D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Writing.JavaScript&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is a deceptively simple language with a lot of weird gotchas, which makes it easy downplay. Especially coming from the native world, where you are used to vendor-owned programming languages which are more focused and have useful type systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&#39;s safe to say that the majority of JavaScript&#39;s warts are fixed by community tooling nowadays. Tools like ESLint, TSLint, Babel, Prettier, TypeScript and Flow make it difficult to write bad code, and the JavaScript community really comes together to fix it&#39;s own problems. This differs from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles&quot;&gt;Sword of Damocles&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;http://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#Developer.Experience&quot;&gt;exists for big OSS projects&lt;/a&gt; in the iOS community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a collection of tools that we use every day in the JS world:
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;article&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt; Project   &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;  What it does  &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt; Why it&#39;s awesome &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io&quot;&gt;Babel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Transform source code &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; You can pick and choose language features &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;article class=&#39;post&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These inter-linked, composable tools basically represent the entire idea of the JavaScript community. You add them to your project, and your project gets all these small config files that eventually create the kind of cohesive tooling that you would expect from a single vendor in a native environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good part is that they are interchangeable, for example, we switched from Flow to TypeScript with roughly 2 weeks work, then a week to come close to perfect. The bad side is that the configuration aspects of these projects feels like something you do once, then forget until it needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote up a glossary of terms from JavaScript when I first started understanding the community, you can &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/11/14/JS-Glossary/&quot;&gt;find it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;But JavaScript is such a downgrade compared to Swift&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, I hear you echoing from the back. This is my own perspective but I consider my workflow in TypeScript to be significantly better than working in Swift. My code is statically analyzed as I type, it is auto-styled as I save, my tests are instant, permanently running and show inside my editor at all times, it&#39;s portable across platforms, it&#39;s quick to execute and embarrassingly fast to compile. I can contribute to all of these tools to improve them. I&#39;d rather work in that environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syntax wise, TypeScript doesn&#39;t have enums with associated types, which I like, nor implicit trailing closures. As a trade-off though TypeScript has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html&quot;&gt;union types&lt;/a&gt;, which work really well for data-modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particular thing I like a lot about JavaScript that the code you read is generally simpler, as nearly all symbols that you use need to be defined in that file. This is because you can only import a single file, instead of an entire target. Meaning if you include a library, you either import the functions you want, or the library as a whole and then extract the functions, and variables that you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&#39;s one major flaw with the JavaScript code we have written so far, it&#39;s the complicated ugliness surrounding the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword. It is &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this&quot;&gt;genuinely complicated&lt;/a&gt;, and a good source of dev-time errors for me. No linters can really catch those errors, so it becomes frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Node.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Node.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to React Native, there are two main environments for writing JavaScript in: the browser, and inside Node. Node is the JavaScript runtime from Google Chrome (called V8, their version of JavaScriptCore) with a UNIX-like baseline set of APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provides relatively few APIs, it is expected that you would use an NPM module for anything particularly high level. The principle being that a standard library (like Foundation in iOS) is always going to be out of date, and incompatible with what web-browsers ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An NPM module is a set of JavaScript files with a particular structure. Generally, there is a &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; to describe the library, and an &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; with the code for the library. Libraries can be as small as a single-function to a typical &quot;XYZKit&quot; you would expect from a CocoaPod. As JavaScript tends to be bundled and minified based on code used, developers mainly worry about the overall file-size of their library. You would use a package manager like NPM or Yarn to manage these dependencies. Node modules have the unique, and dangerous idea of allowing multiple versions of the same library to exist inside your application. This &quot;fixes&quot; the problem of dependency hell, at the cost of potential runtime issues. Here&#39;s a full &lt;a href=&quot;https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2016/08/24/understanding-the-npm-dependency-model/&quot;&gt;explanation of the pattern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When writing JavaScript with React Native, you are using node modules, but &lt;em&gt;strictly speaking&lt;/em&gt; you are not writing a node app. The code that you write is executed inside JavaScriptCore and so doesn&#39;t have access to the UNIX-like API from node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can make it a bit confusing about whether you can or can&#39;t use a library from NPM. This also gets a bit more tricky, for example your tests &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; running inside node. So, it&#39;s fine for your tests to use all of those APIs and libraries, but not your app&#39;s code. So far, from my experience this hasn&#39;t been a problem, in part because of how we use React Native (mainly API -&gt; UI). For example, I researched all of this during the creation of this post, as I hadn&#39;t really noticed the mismatch during active development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;JS.Tooling&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JS Tooling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook&#39;s tooling is 👍. They have an IDE-like text editor called &lt;a href=&quot;https://nuclide.io&quot;&gt;Nuclide&lt;/a&gt;, which is built on GitHub&#39;s text editor Atom. If you&#39;re using the default setup for React Native then you&#39;ll probably have a good time with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We opted for using TypeScript to provide a type system to our React Native - I covered why inside &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/&quot;&gt;Retrospective: Swift at Artsy&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s got substantially easier to use TypeScript with React Native since version 0.45 includes work from Artsy and &lt;a href=&quot;http://futurice.com&quot;&gt;futurice&lt;/a&gt; making it possible via config settings alone. The alternative to TypeScript &lt;a href=&quot;https://flow.org&quot;&gt;is Flow&lt;/a&gt;, which is also a great choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We choose TypeScript because of how well VS Code and TypeScript integrate. It provides an Xcode-like level of integration. Which, IMO, is a high baseline for expectations. It&#39;s definitely less polished, but it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/&quot;&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt; and has substantial monthly releases - which is a very fair trade-off to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The node community is great at automation; we have code formatters and language linters that will auto-fix your code as you press save. We have pre-commit and pre-push hooks that are set up automatically when you start using the project. It means you spend less time thinking about trivial details that add up. It&#39;s wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use the debugging tools built into Chrome for our React Native, instead of something like LLDB. It supports all of the kinds of runtime introspection you would expect from Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Testing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Testing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing was never a priority in the iOS world. I feel like it&#39;s always getting better with each Xcode version, particularly the change in Xcode 9 which allows tests to run in another simulator without turning off your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really put a lot of time and patience into our native testing on iOS. Coming from that world, to the absolute ease of testing in the JavaScript world is pretty breath-taking. Check out my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#Jest&quot;&gt;coverage of Jest&#39;s features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to write tests for your React Native code: in process and out of process. E.g. from the JavaScript side, or in native side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;JS side: Choice of many Open Source test runners, built with hundreds of contributors involved in multi-year test runners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Native side: Probably one or two people making XCTest, one person trying to get some improvements in Xcode each year. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest&quot;&gt;Semi-closed source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We tried out a few native tests, but very quickly we stopped running them. Mainly as we were spending most of our time in a JavaScript environment, so tests would need to run in Xcode. As we don&#39;t need a Mac to run our tests, we can use linux CI servers and get 3-4 minute CI runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Deployment&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Deployment&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is a bit tricky to get your head around at first. React Native is a client-side native library that you don&#39;t make source-code changes to, which interacts with the JavaScript that you bundle with the app (or use the React Native Packager at dev-time.) The JavaScript part of your application is just a file that can be updated, amended or fixed at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not dynamically swizzing or fishhooking methods, you can ship new JavaScript code to your app which can interact with the exact same version of your compiled React Native library. The swizzling, and arbitrary native code changes are the problem that caused app store rejections early in 2017. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/12778#issuecomment-284940049&quot;&gt;React Native wasn&#39;t the cause of those rejections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &quot;deploy my JS anytime&quot; idea is a little bit tricky though, because you can expose native code to your JavaScript. By exposing new functions, you end up with a &quot;versioned bridge&quot; where you make sure that the native functions your JavaScript expects actually exist. So you need to keep track of &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you can update the JavaScript and the exposed native functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what makes it possible to ship bug fixes to your app as fast as the web. We use this, but only for admin users. They can choose the JavaScript for any commit on master, or any active pull request inside a beta version of our app. We don&#39;t ship bug fixes to deployed apps, but we use this ability to provide a simple version of Testflight for our JavaScript code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our app release cadence is still about a month long, moving to React Native hasn&#39;t changed that. We&#39;ve automated the entire process, so it&#39;s a cultural artifact rather than technical. So a day or two for the App Store review is fine, ideally our betas should be getting longer than that for testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Doing.it.right.per.platform&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doing it right per platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve used the term cross-platform quite flippantly in this article to describe code that can run on many platforms. We&#39;ve tried thinking of it as React Native gives us the ability to think in cross-platform terms. We now have most of our app&#39;s root view controllers in React Native, which means we could make a pretty simple Android app re-using that code with a pretty small amount of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&#39;t though. The apps we make &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to fit the platform and feel like the best experience you can get, when you&#39;re potentially buying a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/collect?color=lightblue&amp;amp;price_range=50000.00-%2A&amp;amp;sort=-prices&quot;&gt;&gt; $100,000 artwork&lt;/a&gt;. We&#39;d need an Android engineer with a lot of experience to work on the app, they&#39;d need to be able to work on React Native for Android when we hit roadblocks and to provide useful context on how the app should feel. &lt;em&gt;BTW, if this is you - get in touch (orta@artsymail.com) ;)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have some cross-platform code to get us started - but it won&#39;t feel like the app we want to create until there is native code to take that React and make it shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, where does the cross-platform aspect come from? For most users of React Native, native development has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; been unavailable to them, and now it&#39;s not, because React Native has lowered the barrier to entry. This means many people are aiming to make cross-platform React Native apps that are entirely in JavaScript (see &lt;a href=&quot;#Create.React.Native.App&quot;&gt;Create React Native App&lt;/a&gt;.) They are just trying to get &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; shipped, which could be different from what &lt;em&gt;you the reader&lt;/em&gt; are probably doing. As a native dev, you&#39;re probably more interested in making something really fit the platform and shine. Lots of probablys, yes, but it fits the questions we&#39;re being asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both aspects of this are reasonable. React Native will let you do both. While React Native encourages you to think entirely at the V in MVC only, we still structure our React Native into &lt;code&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt;s and still support unique iOS features via native code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One place where this difference in perspective shows up is with navigation. In iOS it&#39;s pretty straight forwards: use &lt;code&gt;UINavigationController&lt;/code&gt;. For React Native, it&#39;s actually &lt;em&gt;really tricky&lt;/em&gt;, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission/issues/501&quot;&gt;this issue where I write up all the trade-offs&lt;/a&gt; for the current set of APIs. Some of this is just a statement that figuring out the right abstraction is hard here, the other is that a lot of big apps are also at the same size as ours with ~2 years of React Native adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Create.React.Native.App&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create React Native App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest projects to happen in the React Native world in the last 6 months is Create React Native App (CRNA). This is the &quot;super easy to get started&quot; React Native experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that most of the people coming to React Native are web developers, and the idea of writing Objective-C/Swift/Java to them is unappealing. CRNA actually removes the ability for you to write native code, and trades that with letting a company called Expo do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://expo.io&quot;&gt;Expo&lt;/a&gt; are a pretty new VC-backed company, whose work is entirely open source. They&#39;ve done a lot of foundational work in the community, and as individuals they are well respected for contributions to React Native the library - and a bunch of related libraries. You can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779?ct=www&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Expo app&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store to run your CRNA project on any iOS/Android device instantly, and the app has a lot more baseline UI components to work with than React Native does on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With CRNA you are giving up control of the native side, but gaining a lot on the ease-of-use side. CRNA doesn&#39;t force the project to stay this way though, you can eject your app from using Expo and start adding native code to the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I even mention this? Well, if you&#39;re looking at React Native for a greenfield app (e.g. something new), CRNA may be your best option. When you&#39;re getting started, less options is better, and this is the optimal setup according to the React Native team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Animations&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Animations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question which regularly comes up is &quot;How can React Native handle animations?&quot; - at this point the answer is &quot;well enough for 80% of all apps, it&#39;s enough for ours.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two primitives for animation from React Native:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Animated&lt;/code&gt; - This is a fine-grained API for handling changes (we use this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/e4bbde386d54bc8ca73565d667e2701ab0fad0f0/src/lib/Components/Buttons/InvertedButton.tsx#L40-L48&quot;&gt;our buttons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/e4bbde386d54bc8ca73565d667e2701ab0fad0f0/src/lib/Components/Home/ArtistRails/ArtistRail.tsx#L63-L73&quot;&gt;view transitions&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LayoutAnimation&lt;/code&gt; - This API feels a little bit like &lt;code&gt;UIView +animate:&lt;/code&gt; - in that you can tell the layout engine that the next update should be animated instead of replaced. (we use this to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/e4bbde386d54bc8ca73565d667e2701ab0fad0f0/src/lib/Components/Home/ArtworkRails/ArtworkRail.tsx#L77-L80&quot;&gt;handle view expansion&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These provide enough for most use-cases, but there is a more direct API and a few more JS-level techniques that you can use if you are really starting to feel like you&#39;re dropping frames inside a specific animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;The.long-term.aspects.of.React.Native&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The long-term aspects of React Native&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if Facebook stop maintaining React Native? Today it obviously doesn&#39;t look like it, but if you&#39;re talking the next 5 years - maybe it&#39;s not that rosy. The JavaScript world moves real fast, 5 years ago React didn&#39;t exist and Node still hadn&#39;t had its &lt;a href=&quot;http://anandmanisankar.com/posts/nodejs-iojs-why-the-fork/&quot;&gt;big divorce&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/foundation-v4-announce/&quot;&gt;got back together&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our perspective on dependencies has been that &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/09/17/Cocoa-Architecture-Dependencies/&quot;&gt;you should always own them&lt;/a&gt; in the sense that you have an understanding of how they work technically and culturally. This means for the larger projects, you should feel comfortable being able to make PRs back to the project, or feel comfortable that the vendor will fix bugs for you. The latter is not necessarily something that Facebook will be doing for you. They specifically call out that React Native is being built in the open, but that they are building and working on things that affect Facebook in production and then look at larger platform issues. You can get a sense of this by reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react-native/wiki/Roadmap&quot;&gt;the React Native roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. These aims cover the rest of this year, and next year they&#39;ll re-evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re pretty comfortable that if Facebook stop committing to React Native tomorrow, we (as Artsy) can continue to keep the project stable and at the same place across iOS releases. There&#39;d be a learning curve, but we&#39;re not the only company that&#39;d be willing to do this too: AirBnb, Expo, Uber, Microsoft, GeekyAnts and Wix all participate at &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/06/21/react-native-monthly-1.html&quot;&gt;a very granular level&lt;/a&gt; and would probably make sure that the code you ship today will work with iOS 12 and so on - as they need that too. Should you rely on that? If you&#39;re small enough then I think it&#39;s reasonable. If you&#39;re a medium sized company, I think you should have at least one engineer who understands and can deep dive into the dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a relevant example, Three20 had a very &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jverkoey/nimbus/wiki/Three20-Migration-Guide&quot;&gt;reasonable deprecation path&lt;/a&gt;, it&#39;s just that a lot of people didn&#39;t have the technical ability to migrate off. Frameworks like React Native and Three20 lower the barrier to entry considerably. The trade-off is that once you end up having to leave those frameworks, you have a pretty big learning curve to the baseline OS frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my perspective, in Artsy there are only 2-3 projects that are 5 years old (Artsy was roughly founded in 2010) and I know a few of those are &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/04/14/artsy-technology-stack-2017/&quot;&gt;getting split into new apps&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;m not sure if &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; need to be looking &lt;em&gt;that far&lt;/em&gt; ahead. Our keystone &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/eigen&quot;&gt;iOS app, Eigen&lt;/a&gt; was started in 2013, and has already gone through 2 complete internal transformations as our requirements and opportunities change. It&#39;s very feasible that in 4 years we&#39;ll be at a very different place again. We choose to not turn down something that so drastically improves our developer and speed for end users for that risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Facebook indeed seem to be really happy with React, and React Native - making this question a useful hypothetical. Facebook are moving more big projects to use it internally, and there is a great discussion on how that is ongoing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUxHv-kH7w&amp;amp;list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0kj3saZuh4vzfldxEdH5RH&amp;amp;index=2&quot;&gt;this React Conf keynote from Jing Chen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Performance&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your app is now running a lot of its code in JavaScript, isn&#39;t that slower? It&#39;s definitely true that your JavaScript will not be as fast as Objective-C or Swift. We haven&#39;t benchmarked our before/after view controllers because it&#39;s not a fair comparison, we switched &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/06/19/graphql-for-mobile/&quot;&gt;from REST to GrahpQL&lt;/a&gt; at the same time. Our networking time was reduced so drastically, that it&#39;s hard to talk about the JS vs native performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there are a few advantages to running your app in JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no main thread, so you cannot block the UIKit UI thread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no need to recreate JSON into native representations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of the hard work in React Native (layout, view manipulation) is done natively and in its own off-main thread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For critical code, you can move to native, we did this for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/emission/commit/a404ccf1519ec79fc0bfadf6e572d990caa0a9ec&quot;&gt;image thumbnails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One place that doesn&#39;t feel good writing in JavaScript is scroll events. This code has to generally be performance critical. This affects you when you want to have fancy transitions in your view controllers, however the animations API uses native code and with some careful consideration it&#39;s very feasible to re-write those scroll events into a declarative API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you can look for better abstractions in React Native, the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/listview.html&quot;&gt;ListView&lt;/a&gt; component provides quite a lot of the behavior you might want to use scroll events for, other times you may want to outright create a native view and then expose that as a component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found that the majority of our view controllers do a lot of work on init, then generally don&#39;t do any more heavy lifting. So aside from our custom image thumbnails, we&#39;ve not hit a point where we&#39;ve had to move any code to be native in a year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Facebook.patent.clause&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook patent clause&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has come up a few times in discussion, Facebook have a bit of a custom license for their open source. Back in 2015, they made changes to the license that makes this no problem for everyone but patent trolls. You can find a bunch of resources for further reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/gaearon/df0c4025e67399af72786d7ac7c819cc&quot;&gt;on this gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;React.Dependencies&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;React Dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes up in every post we make on React Native, because it&#39;s always worth mentioning. React Native has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native&quot;&gt;51 dependencies&lt;/a&gt;, which when resolved comes up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://libraries.io/npm/react-native/0.46.0-rc.2/tree&quot;&gt;around ~650 dependent&lt;/a&gt; projects. This is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of dependencies. Remember that the JavaScript ecosystem does not have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation&quot;&gt;equivalent of Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and so to create a standard library, you use dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dependency can be as small as &lt;a href=&quot;https://yarnpkg.com/en/packages?q=lodash-a&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;a single function&lt;/a&gt;, or as fully featured as React Native. So it doesn&#39;t really help to know the number in terms of anything other than &quot;it&#39;s a lot&quot;. In this case, it is just the culture of JavaScript and node to work in this fashion. It&#39;s like if you had to ship your version of Foundation and Cocoa with your app, instead of relying on the ones built into the OS. First you&#39;d have to pay the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikeal/status/874711319412330496&quot;&gt;memory and load time&lt;/a&gt; price for it in your app, and then you have a bazillion dependencies you don&#39;t need like iAd or SpriteKit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These unused dependencies &lt;a href=&quot;https://rollupjs.org&quot;&gt;can be removed at deploy time&lt;/a&gt;, but React Native is not at this point yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Places.where.React.Native.hasn.t.fit.for.us&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Places where React Native hasn&#39;t fit for us&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first draft had notes on some of our mobile apps where we thought it might not fit. After some discussion, we changed our mind. So then our answer: Nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note though, &lt;em&gt;the types of apps we create are exclusively API driven, with a unique visual style which totally covers the exposed UI surface. React Native is a great fit for this kind of app&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main app Eigen, is a &lt;code&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; browser, and React Native components are just one type of &lt;code&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; that can be browsed. Nearly every &lt;code&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; is the representation of an API endpoint, so React Native + &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/relay/&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/a&gt; is a great match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to say that &lt;a href=&quot;http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/&quot;&gt;our Kiosk app, Eidolon&lt;/a&gt;, might not be a good fit because of its reliance on handling a credit-card reader and that the app was good fit for being a storyboard-driven app. However, I&#39;m not so sure about this anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project &lt;a href=&quot;https://storybook.js.org&quot;&gt;React Storybooks&lt;/a&gt; is not a direct replacement for storyboards, but as a live-programming/prototyping environment it&#39;s 👍. The credit-card reader is already wrapped into a Reactive paradigm, going one step further and making it a JavaScript EventEmitter isn&#39;t a big-jump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our tvOS app Emergence could probably be re-written in a week at this point. Is it worth a re-write? No. If I had to write it from scratch, would I use React Native? Probably, but it would depend on how stable tvOS support feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our oldest app, Energy, is an app for keeping your portfolio of artworks with you at all times. Again, API -&gt; UI. It&#39;s an app which currently has a lot of demands on running offline. This is the only part that used to make me feel a bit unsure what that could look like with respect to moving the interface to React Native. However, changes to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/relay/&quot;&gt;Relay ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; which could allow us to create a simple Core Data backend, have reduced those worries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;When.to.choose.React.Native.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When to choose React Native?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React Native provides a cross-platform API, and so it can fall into a watered down version of the API it abstracts. This means that it can be a bit more work than normal to use obviously iOS-specific features like &lt;code&gt;ARKit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UIUserActivity&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CSSearchableIndex&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;UIUserNotification&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say more work, because you definitely can still use them, but that transitions between your React code and your native code will require a bit more work than had you always been writing it natively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s not enough of a downside to contrast against:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; better way to handle state and user-interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The potential to write code that is cross-platform, and also share ideas with the web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An open development environment that respects your time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Especially when there is an Xcode project which you can use to do whatever you want with, you just need to learn how to jump back and forth between the two worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React Native is a great fit for apps that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are driven by an API, or an obvious state-store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want to have a unique look and feel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the final thing. When React Native was proposed as an option for us, the majority of our mobile dev team were not exactly excited at the prospect of using it. As we grew to understand the positive changes it was bringing for us, and our users, I was really happy that &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/alloy&quot;&gt;Eloy&lt;/a&gt; was willing to say &lt;em&gt;&quot;I think this could work.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; Ash&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ashfurrow.com/blog/swift-vs-react-native-feels/&quot;&gt;experience feels similar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s less risky now, but it&#39;s obviously a big dependency inside your app. Ideally, someone in your team should be able to feel comfortable reading, and potentially fixing code inside React Native for the platforms you ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Integrating.into.an.Existing.app&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Integrating into an Existing app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re thinking of adding React Native to an existing app, first read &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/08/24/On-Emission/&quot;&gt;on emission&lt;/a&gt;. Our usage of React Native is that it offers a series of components which are consumed by our app as a CocoaPod. This CocoaPods exposes &lt;code&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt;s which can be used anywhere inside the app. This is the probably same pattern Airbnb, and Facebook use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you&#39;ve read post, check out AirBnB&#39;s experiences &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWitQoPgs8w&quot;&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUxHv-kH7w&amp;amp;list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0kj3saZuh4vzfldxEdH5RH&amp;amp;index=2&quot;&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Greenfield&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greenfield&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d recommend to start with a CRNA app, it&#39;s a good starting point. I would feel safe that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/EJECTING.md&quot;&gt;you can eject&lt;/a&gt; out of the environment provided when the app becomes complex enough to warrant native code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Wrap-up&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the right place for a big call to action, where I declare that React Native is the future for all development and that it fixes all problems. I&#39;m not going to do that. I think React Native is definitely the right choice for our team, and there are many apps that could have been created faster and cheaper by using React Native.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s safe to say we all were initially put off by JavaScript, but TypeScript has grown to be my favourite language, knocking Ruby off that pedestal. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9999&quot;&gt;There&#39;s potential that could change&lt;/a&gt; but we can only live in the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, React Native is a well thought out library, that can really help build better products when you understand the right way to apply it. It can help you be cross-platform on mobile, but also cross-platform with the web. For example, our React Native project has a sibling project on the web with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/reaction&quot;&gt;exact same setup&lt;/a&gt;, so any improvements in one move to the other. Which was unimaginable 2 years ago. We can truly consider sharing logic and ideas with the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re considering a new app, or a grand re-write, React Native should be considered as one of your options.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Danger</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Danger came out of two needs. One from the needs of a growing dev team working together full-time, and the other from the needs of a completely asymmetric large Open Source project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A work environment dev team is a complex place. You naturally grow, and to grow safely you add process. Process is a mixed bag, it&#39;s a net benefit at the trade-off of individual&#39;s time vs team cohesion. You want to grow your team guided by smart applications of process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, working on a large open source project, it&#39;s easy to feel overwhelmed at the amount of work that needs to get done on a daily basis. The growth of your OSS team probably doesn&#39;t tie to the amount of work that needs to be done. Especially if you&#39;re like me, and you don&#39;t want to be maintaining OSS as a 2nd full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you do? Well in a work environment you don&#39;t really have a choice, as a team you hold each other to the rules that you set. In OSS, you sacrifice your spare time or you can find time at work, you could stop or you could burn out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the environment in which the idea of Danger was incubated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today mark version 1.0 of the second version of Danger. I&#39;m going to cover what they are, how they continue to grow and what I see their trajectory as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Why.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danger came from a need to customise the GitHub workflow for pull requests. In a work context, we wanted to add process like CHANGELOGs and be more thorough about testing. In Open Source, we needed to stop asking the same things to drive-by contributors. Their patches are valuable for sure, but asking for the same changes each time gets tiring. We want to work at a higher level of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases you want a way to give instant feedback for things that are &quot;Unit Tests have failed&quot; or &quot;Code could not compile&quot;. However, it&#39;s hard to give feedback that says &quot;You have not added a CHANGELOG entry in the right format.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically CI would only provide a binary: true or false response to the changes for review. We want a more shades of grey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;What.does.Danger.do.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does Danger do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danger acts as a way of creating unit tests at code review level. It gives you the ability to write tests that say: &quot;has this file changed?&quot;, &quot;does the contents of new files include this string?&quot;, &quot;does the build log include a warning we know is bad news?&quot; then the results of those tests are moved back into the place you&#39;re talking about the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, you need to be able to create your own rules. Every team has different dynamics, and while it makes sense to offer a set of a set of standard rules that can work across a lot of projects - I&#39;m pretty sure that the needs of the Artsy engineering team is different from the needs of your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danger runs your code, and provides a set of easy to use APIs for you to build these useful culture rules. You write your rules in code, we call these files Dangerfiles. Similar to how a testing framework would give a set of expectations. The general gist is Danger provides access to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes from Git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes from GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interacting with Danger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By making per-project rules with these APIs, you can cover most rote tasks involved in code review. To make it easy for anyone to run Danger on every pull request, Danger was made to run during continuous integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;OK..so..2.versions.of.Danger..&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;OK, so &quot;2 versions of Danger&quot;?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first implemented Danger in Ruby. Ruby is a great language for building terminal apps, in the iOS community it&#39;s the language in which the largest OSS projects are built in. So, as someone used to building apps in that space, it wasn&#39;t really a debate what language to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ruby build of Danger is now at 5.x with almost 100 releases, it&#39;s a solid exploration into code review automation. Ultimately though, I started to feel three main pain-points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Artsy, we moved our mobile team to React Native, and other teams were also consolidating on JavaScript everywhere. It felt weird using a Ruby inside a strictly JS only context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to re-create the environment of a PR was tricky from inside the CI. For example most providers are good at about saving on space and bandwidth during a run, and Danger often has to ruin that in order to replicate the PR locally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to explore server-side Dangerfiles. I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable hosting a server that allows anyone to run their own Ruby code. Ruby isn&#39;t built with sandboxing in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I explored the idea of having JavaScript based Dangerfiles inside the Ruby version of Danger. I did this by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danger/danger/pull/422&quot;&gt;bridging Danger&#39;s Ruby objects into a JavaScript context&lt;/a&gt; and allowing bi-directional communication between the two. This handled some of the immediate needs, but proved inadequate when working with JavaScript&#39;s simple system library and it ignored all other JavaScript tooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enough time, I came to the conclusion that realistically, to use JavaScript properly, you need node modules and npm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So 10 months ago I decided it was worth starting from scratch and re-created Danger in JavaScript. I had time to consider what I would do differently, and this time I added one key additional restraints on the system: Data can only come from an API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This constraint negates one of the key problems with running running a Dangerfile on a server - having to have a copy of the code and the PR&#39;s environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, JavaScript has a much simpler model for evaluating, importing and exporting code and so whitelisting modules and functions can be feasible for a hosted version of Danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src =&quot;/images/danger/danger.png&quot; style=&quot;width:50%&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;L1.0.is.my.middle.name&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;1.0 is my middle name&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any software project used in production should probably be 1.0, but in addition to production use a library needs documentation to be 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling Danger production ready means doing the entire &lt;a href=&quot;http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/07/03/handling-big-projects/&quot;&gt;Defensive OSS&lt;/a&gt; process: Documentation, Guides, API Reference, Website and Branding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once each version of Danger had started to mature to a point that the user-facing aspect stopped changing I started focusing on the documentation engine and website. In both cases, a considerable amount of documentation is generated from the source code of Danger. I&#39;m a big fan of keeping that inside the source code and building documentation sites which import it directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;So.what.can.I.do.with.Danger.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So what can I do with Danger?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one way this is a bit like asking, so what can I test with unit tests? Anything, within the scope of: the PR, build artifacts and introspecting the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll cover a quick API overview, then talk about how you can work with these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Git&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Git&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What files have been added, removed or changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes specific to a file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking into Commits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploring the Diff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;GitHub...GitLab...BitBucket&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to the PR&#39;s JSON representation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistent access for PR body, title, author across all platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Util functions for linking to files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Danger&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Danger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handle running other Dangerfiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handles plugin management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides a set of utility functions that would often get used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Messaging&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Messaging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave warnings, messages and markdown comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave errors, marking the build as failed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post any of the above of the above inside a file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a GitHub review, and use the above messaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Plugins&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure for shared rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opens up the ability to validate tricky things with an easy API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The API differs between the JS and Ruby version, not drastically - but there are no plugins for Danger JS yet. That&#39;s still a bit away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;OK..got.it.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OK, got it.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s cover a few examples of the kind of tests can you write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Checking.for.changes.to.a.specific.file&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Checking for changes to a specific file&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking for a CHANGELOG. This was the first rule imagined for Danger, I add it to every project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first implementation of this rule can just be a check if the file &lt;code&gt;CHANGELOG.md&lt;/code&gt; is modified in any PR, that can then be
revised to also check whether there are git changes related to your app. Then documentation, README, tooling updates
don&#39;t require an entry. We also check if the PR title says &quot;trivial&quot; and skip the CHANGELOG check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in standardizing on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/&quot;&gt;keepachangelog.com&lt;/a&gt; format there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dblock/danger-changelog&quot;&gt;danger-changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other examples around this is pinging specific people when a file has changed, or failing if a file that&#39;s never meant
to be modified is changed, warning about potential semantic version updates for changes to specific files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Checking.the.results.of.command-line.tools&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Checking the results of command-line tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Artsy developer blog runs both a spell checker, and a prose linter. These report back on files added or
modified during the PR. As someone known for writing loose and quick, having a machine provide some automatic feedback
makes it easy to not waste my reviewers time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is done by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dbgrandi/danger-prose&quot;&gt;danger-prose&lt;/a&gt; plugin, which wraps both an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lukeapage/node-markdown-spellcheck&quot;&gt;npm module&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amperser/proselint/&quot;&gt;python egg&lt;/a&gt;.
The plugin handles installing and running the CLI, then converts the output into markdown for github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Handling.build.artifacts&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Handling build artifacts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Danger runs after the build process, you can read build logs to provide better feedback. This can range from taking
the results of a test run and posting what has failed (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orta/danger-junit&quot;&gt;danger-junit&lt;/a&gt;), to finding specific strings inside
build logs and highlighting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our native iOS app, when a developer accidentally adds code which accesses the network in a test. That is logged out
during the build. Then later, danger will read the logs to find any mentions of this and post it in the comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;PR.Metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;PR Metadata&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every team&#39;s workflow is different, but it&#39;s pretty common to use a tool other than code review for keeping track of a project&#39;s momentum. You can use Danger to warn people that they haven&#39;t included a Trello, or JIRA ticket reference on
every PR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar approach could be to warn if someone is sending a PR to a branch other than the preferred branch. This works
well if you use the git-flow model for branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We nearly always add a check to see if someone is assigned to a PR, and warn it it&#39;s unassigned in front-end projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Using.the.platform.API&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Using the platform API&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no limits here, by using the API from your platform you can perform any sorts of checks. In the Danger repo
we use the GitHub API to note whether someone is in the Danger org, to remind the core team to invite them to the org
after submitting a PR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Introducing.Danger&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introducing Danger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, maybe that&#39;s got you thinking &lt;em&gt;&quot;ah, I know a process I can automate&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be easy to try and jump straight from no Dangerfile to a many-hundred lined complex set of cultural rules. I&#39;d advise against introducing a long list of rules for Danger all at once. In my experience, gradual integration works better. The entire team may have agreed on the changes upfront, but slower adoption has worked better for teams new to working with Danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Artsy we&#39;ve found that first just integrating Danger with a single simple rule (like checking for a CHANGELOG entry) then starting to introduce them piece-meal from different contributors has made it easier to go from &quot;Ah, we shouldn&#39;t do that again&quot; to &quot;Oh, we could make a Danger rule for that&quot; to &quot;Here&#39;s the PR&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;Which.Danger.should.I.use.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Which Danger should I use?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This definitely depends on the project, there&#39;s a longer discussion &lt;a href=&quot;http://danger.systems/js/js-vs-ruby.html&quot;&gt;on the site&lt;/a&gt; too, but here&#39;s the main gist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danger Ruby&lt;/strong&gt; is more mature, has more features, a solid plugin eco-system and covers more platforms. It&#39;s in a great place and is unlikely to have breaking changes from this point onwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danger JS&lt;/strong&gt; has a bigger potential for growth, is &quot;stable enough&quot;, you can create plugins and will be able to do things that the Ruby version could not - eventually. Right now it only works with GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;a name=&quot;Onwards.and.Upwards&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Onwards and Upwards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the JavaScript version of Danger in a great place ready for production, I can start more serious work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danger/peril#peril&quot;&gt;Peril&lt;/a&gt;. Peril is a hosted web-service that runs Dangerfiles against GitHub events, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danger/peril/blob/master/VISION.md&quot;&gt;the VISION.md&lt;/a&gt;. Those events span from a new user being created, to a new issue on a repo. Peril lets you run your own complex rules across an entire org. This can be a really powerful way to audit and improve entire-company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started using Peril in Artsy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/reaction-force/pull/184&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. So it&#39;s starting to become a thing internally. It&#39;ll be awesome to explore the idea of org-wide rules. I think we&#39;re starting with making sure we assign someone on a PR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So give Danger a shot, and if you&#39;re bold. give &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danger/peril#peril&quot;&gt;Peril&lt;/a&gt; a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
