    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Artsy, we try hard to <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/orta/getting-eigen-out?slide=35">test</a>
our iOS applications to ensure that we avoid regressions and have a clearly
defined spec of how our apps should look and behave. One of the core pieces of
our testing setup is <a href="https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case">FBSnapshotTestCase</a>,
a library written by Facebook to compare views at runtime with images of those
views that are known to be correct. If the images differ, the test fails. We
also use <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis</a> for continuous integration.</p>

<p>Lately, we&#8217;ve been noticing a friction between the developers on the iOS team
and the tools we&#8217;re using to test our apps: while Travis allows us to easily
access the logs of test runs, it can only indicate that a snapshot test failed,
not why it failed. That&#8217;s because the images that are compared are locked on
Travis&#8217; machine – we cannot access those images, so we can&#8217;t see the
differences. This is <em>really</em> promblematic when the tests pass locally but fail
only on Travis.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="http://twitter.com/orta">Orta</a> and I were discussing this
problem and we came up with a potential solution. Since the images were stored
on disk on Travis&#8217; machine, why not just upload them somewhere we <em>can</em> see
them? Like an S3 bucket. We could even generate a basic HTML page showing you
the different test failures.</p>

<p>Time passed and, later on, I had tests passing locally but failing on Travis.
I saw an opprtunity to build something new. I&#8217;m not a proficient Ruby developer,
but I enjoy learning new things, so I decided to create a Ruby gem that could
fit within our existing testing pipeline. A lot of the structure for the code
came from an existing gem we already use with Travis, <a href="https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty">xcpretty</a>.
With an example of how gems that support iOS testing are written, I was on my
way to creating my own.</p>

<p>At first, things were very difficult. While I had contributed small patches to
existing Ruby projects before, I had never created a brand new one from scratch.
The existing <a href="http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/">guides</a> were very
helpful, and I found help from the CocoaPods developers when I had questions
about things like the arcane semantics of Ruby&#8217;s <code>require</code> syntax.</p>

<p>Eventually, I had a working proof-of-concept. Everything seemed ready to go, and
I prepared to incorporate my new tool, which I called <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/second_curtain">Second Curtain</a>,
into my pull request on the Artsy repo. But there was a problem.</p>

<p>Second Curtain relies on environment variables to get access to the S3 bucket
where it stores the images. I planned on using Travis&#8217; system to <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/">encrypt</a>
those credentials. It turns out, for very good reasons, encrypted environment
variables are not available on pull requests created on forks of repositories.
This is a problem because of the way that <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/01/29/how-art-dot-sy-uses-github-to-build-art-dot-sy/">Artsy uses GitHub</a>.
While it&#8217;s not a problem for a closed-source repository to have (restrictive)
access to an S3 bucket, it would be irresponsible to expose S3 credentials for
an open-source project. I&#8217;m <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/second_curtain/issues/5">working</a>
on a solution.</p>

<p>Orta helped with the design aspect of the tool; while uploading the images was
sufficient, we could make the process of seeing the differences between the two
images even easier. He created a <a href="https://eigen-ci.s3.amazonaws.com/snapshots/2014-08-04--15-47/index.html">HTML page</a>
that would allow developers to see the before-and-after versions by moving their
mouse cursor over the different images.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.ashfurrow.com/github/second_curtain.png" alt="Image Diff" /></p>

<p>In the end, I got Second Curtain to work with Artsy&#8217;s iOS repository and I
discovered the discrepency between the two images: due to a timezone difference
between my computer and Travis&#8217;, a date was being formatted differently. Not a
difficult thing to fix, but not something I would have ever been able to
discover had I not been able to see the images side-by-side.</p>

<p>So after all that, one line of Objective-C was changed and the tests passed – my
pull request was merged. I learnt a lot about how Ruby developers structure
their code and what tools they use to write software. While I&#8217;m happy to return
to iOS apps for a while, it was a great experience and I&#8217;m hoping to bring some
of the ideas I discovered writing Ruby back to Objective-C.</p>

    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/08/04/aspect-oriented-programming-and-aranalytics</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Analytics are common in iOS applications. They help inform our decisions
about products. Since analytics are so common, Artsy developed a library called
<a href="https://github.com/orta/ARAnalytics">ARAnalytics</a>. This library provides a
single interface to many different backend analytics providers, freeing
developers from having to write code for each of the providers that they&#8217;re
using.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s consider a typical view controller on iOS. View controllers on iOS
represent the glue code between models and views. When a model changes, the view
controller updates the appearance of the UI. Similarly, when the UI is
interacted with by the user, the view controller updates the model. This is the
core of any standard iOS application.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s say that a button is pressed. We&#8217;ll handle that interaction in a
method called <code>buttonWasPressed:</code>. We&#8217;ll want to update our model, but also to
track the analytics event.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">buttonWasPressed:</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">id</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">sender</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">model</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">hearted</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">YES</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">ARAnalytics</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;hearted&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Simple enough, but consider that the analytics tracking code doesn&#8217;t fall within
our definition of a view controller – the button handler just happens to be a
convenient place to put the tracking code. Also consider that <em>every single</em>
button handler is going to have to have similar code implemented.</p>

<h2>There has to be a better way.</h2>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="http://twitter.com/steipete">Pete Steinberger</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/orta">Orta Therox</a>
were talking and the topic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">Aspect-Oriented Programming</a>,
specifically in the context of analytics. AOP takes a look at the different
<em>conerns</em> of an application – logical, cohesive units of functionality. While
most programming paradigms, including those used with Objective-C, group and
encapsulate these concerns, there are some concerns that are &#8220;cross-cutting&#8221;
because they are involved through several other concerns.</p>

<p>Analytics is such a cross-cutting concern. That makes it a prime target for
being abstracted away using AOP. Using <a href="http://albertodebortoli.github.io/blog/2014/03/25/an-aspect-oriented-approach-programming-to-ios-analytics/">another blog post</a>  as an example, we set about <a href="https://github.com/orta/ARAnalytics/pull/74">integrating an AOP-like DSL within ARAnalytics</a>
that would allow you to define all of your analytics in one spot.</p>

<p>The interface would be simple. When providing your API keys to the various
backend services you&#8217;d like to use with ARAnalytics, you&#8217;d also provide a
dictionary specifying the classes you&#8217;d like us to &#8220;hook into&#8221;. Whenever a
selector from an instance of the given class was invoked, we&#8217;d execute the
analytics event specified in the dictionary.</p>

<p>Since Objective-C has a dynamic runtime, we could have swizzled the instance
methods on the classes you specified in the dictionary. This gets a little
tricky and represents a lot of work for us. We could directly swizzle the
instance methods on the classes in question, but wrapping parameters of variable
types and in various numbers becomes a chore. If we didn&#8217;t get it done
perfectly, we&#8217;d risk introducing bugs into the entire application.</p>

<p>I wrote a proof-of-concept of analytics using AOP with <a href="http://reactivecocoa.io">ReactiveCocoa</a>.
It worked, but was a little hacky since it involved the swizzling of <code>alloc</code>.
ReactiveCocoa is also a large framework to be included just for the sake of
analytics. Additionally, its interface exposed ReactiveCocoa&#8217;s <code>RACTuple</code> class,
which smells like a leaky abstraction.</p>

<h2>What could we do?</h2>

<p>Well, about the same time, Pete Steinberger open sourced a new framework just
for AOP called <a href="https://github.com/steipete/Aspects">Aspects</a>. Pete did all the
difficult work of swizzling methods with variable parameter lists, including
wrapping primitive parameters in values.</p>

<p>Pete and I worked together to get Aspects working with ARAnalytics, removing our
dependency on ReactiveCocoa.</p>

<h2>How to Use it</h2>

<p>Using ARAnalytics with the new DSL is super-easy. Just add either <code>ARAnalytics</code>
or <code>ARAnalytics/DSL</code> to your podfile, specifying a version of at least 2.6. Run
<code>pod install</code> and you&#8217;re ready to get started.</p>

<p>Since all of your analytics are going to be specified in one spot, and that spot
is going to get rather large, I&#8217;d recommend creating an Objective-C category on
your app delegate to set up all of your analytics. Then you can call this
<code>setupAnalytics</code> method when your app launches.</p>

<p>Now our <code>buttonWasPressed:</code> method is <em>very</em> straightforward:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">buttonWasPressed:</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">id</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">sender</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">model</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">hearted</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">YES</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The view controller is now <em>only</em> responsible for what it should be responsible
for: mediating interactions between the view and the model. Awesome! Even
cooler, we can provide fine-grain control over which analytics events are
invoked and with what properties they are sent with. Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>

<p>So you see that even though you&#8217;re defining your analytics once, at application
startup, you&#8217;re still able to provide dynamic, per-instance behaviour and event
properties.</p>

<p>Finally, we&#8217;ve also written support for page views. In a few lines, you can
have every view controller track its page view with ARAnalytics.</p>

<p>This code will track a page view with the title the same as the view
controller&#8217;s <code>title</code> property, but just like with events you can provide
fine-grained handling.</p>

<h2>Some Limitations</h2>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/steipete/Aspects/issues/11">limitation</a> on
Aspects that wasn&#8217;t fully understood until we used the new AOP approach to
analytics in the Artsy app. Selectors can only be &#8220;hooked into&#8221; once per class
hierarchy. That  means that you cannot create a tracked events for two
difference view controllers, both on the <code>viewWillAppear:</code> selector. This is a
temporary limitation while the Aspects library is being worked on. In the mean
time, you are free to use the <a href="https://github.com/orta/ARAnalytics/tree/ashfurrow-temporary-dsl-fix">original implementation</a>
with ReactiveCocoa, which doesn&#8217;t have this limitation and which we are using
currently.</p>

<h2>What we Learnt</h2>

<p>AOP is a really cool paradigm that can reduce tight coupling in your code and
increase your overall level of cohesion. Its applications extend beyond just
analytics – any time you have a behaviour that&#8217;s being exhibited in several
abstractions in your code, you should consider if using AOP to replace that
behaviour might make for cleaner code and more cohesive abstractions.</p>

<p>Finally, I got to make my first significant contribution to open source at
Artsy. It was awesome to be able to collaborate with Pete and Orta on this
project, as well as receive feedback from developers who are already using
ARAnalytics.</p>

    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/07/09/retain-scroll-position-in-infinite-scroll</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4b7e6aefa00b96ba2804b235aaaa811bbb893c4e/687474703a2f2f7777772e6578706c61696e786b63642e636f6d2f77696b692f696d616765732f352f35362f696e66696e6974655f7363726f6c6c696e672e706e67" alt="Maybe we should give up on the whole idea of a 'back' button. 'Show me that thing I was looking at a moment ago' might just be too complicated an idea for the modern web." /></p>

<p>Although <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7314965">some find infinite scroll to be a contentious topic</a> at Artsy we&#8217;ve found it to be a useful element in many portions of our site such as <a href="https://artsy.net/browse/artworks?medium=prints&amp;price_range=-1%3A1000">filtering</a>. However, we&#8217;ve run into a common and painful usability issue with infinite scroll. That is clicking on an item redirects to the next page, losing your scroll position, and losing your place when going back. To solve this we have come up with a clever little solution using an iframe.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We&#8217;re pleased to announce we&#8217;ve open sourced this solution into <a href="https://github.com/artsy/scroll-frame">scrollFrame</a>.</p>

<p>scrollFrame borrows from sites like Pinterest that avoid this problem by opening the next page in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window">modal window</a>. Only instead of having to build your entire page client-side, scrollFrame will intercept your click and open the next page in an iframe that sits on top of your current page and covers your viewport (acting as a sort of modal that doesn&#8217;t look like a modal). scrollFrame will then hook into the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history">HTML5 history API</a> to remove the iframe modal on back button and keep your URL up to date. <a href="https://artsy.net/browse">See it in action on our browse page!</a></p>

<p>scrollFrame only solves this specific problem with infinite scroll but we&#8217;ve gotten a lot of mileage out of it and we hope you will too!</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/06/20/artsys-first-closed-source-pod/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-20T17:53:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/06/20/artsys-first-closed-source-pod</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I joined Artsy, <a href="http://code.dblock.org">dB</a> pitched me this idea: <em>Open source as default.</em></p>

<p>I took this to heart. I genuinely believe the idea behind the philosophy. It&#8217;s cool that our real product isn&#8217;t our implementations on the web or native but the data which powers it - <a href="https://artsy.net/theartgenomeproject">the Art Genome Project</a>. Similarly, I spend a bunch of time <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/ARCollectionViewMasonryLayout">on</a> <a href="https://github.com/dblock/ARASCIISwizzle">open</a> <a href="https://github.com/dblock/ios-snapshot-test-case-expecta">sourcing</a> <a href="https://github.com/dblock/ARTiledImageView">solid</a> <a href="https://github.com/dstnbrkr/DRBOperationTree">abstractions</a> <a href="https://github.com/orta/ORSimulatorKeyboardAccessor">from</a> <a href="https://github.com/orta/ORStackView">our</a> <a href="https://github.com/orta/ARAnalytics">apps</a>, always taking the opinion if something is used in more than one place, it should be open sourced.</p>

<p>This week I pushed some libraries that were a bit different, read on to find out why.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>I was modernizing a section of <a href="http://orta.github.io/#folio-header-unit">Folio</a> that hasn&#8217;t changed in 2 years to use custom UILabel subclasses consistent with <a href="https://iphone.artsy.net">the Artsy iOS app</a> and realized I was copying and pasting a large amount of code from one app to the other. This got me thinking about ways to keep this code in one place, as we might start another project which needs these same styles soon.</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>I didn&#8217;t want to put it on the public CocoaPods Spec Repo, because it&#8217;s not very relevant to the larger community, but in keeping with our philosophy of &#8220;open source by default,&#8221; I definitely wanted to publish it as an example for others. The most elegant answer was to create our own <a href="https://github.com/artsy/specs">public Specs Repo</a>, which serves as a good reference when people want to know what a private specs repo looks like.</p>

<p>Like anyone who has tried to modularize a pretty large code-base, it turns out a lot of things were connected together. I couldn&#8217;t just build my <a href="http://github.com/Artsy/Artsy-UILabels">Artsy+UILabels</a> repo and put everything in there. Instead I had to also build Artsy+UIFonts and <a href="http://github.com/Artsy/Artsy-UIColors">Artsy+UIColors</a>.</p>

<p>One of the good things about having to build three libraries is that I became very familiar with <code>pod lib create</code>. This is a command for building the scaffolding around a CocoaPod, making it much easier to create something fast. We had been holding off doing a <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/pod-template/pull/33">big update</a> to the command because no-one knew what WWDC would bring. Now we know, so I&#8217;ve worked on a new version of the command that programmatically manipulates an example project via <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj">xcodeproj</a>. I&#8217;ve used it in creating all of these libraries. Expect to see it on the CocoaPods blog soon.</p>

<h2>Caveat</h2>

<p>I built three libraries, but one of them is unique. I modelled Artsy+UIFonts from <a href="http://kylefuller.co.uk">Kyle Fuller</a>&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/kylef/OpenSans-pod">OpenSans-pod</a>, where the CocoaPod has the font resources and installing it moves them into your project. This is great for a free or open-source font, but would break commercial font licenses. For that reason, we don&#8217;t have the ability to open source that project. Thus Artsy Mobile&#8217;s first closed-source library.</p>

<p>This is a great example of how you can build a private specs repo, whilst the public-private aspect is not applicable to most companies. I find it to be a nice halfway house between open source as default, and keeping something internal.

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/06/17/building-the-xcode-plugin-snapshots/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-17T10:50:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/06/17/building-the-xcode-plugin-snapshots</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m the kind of guy who thinks better tooling means better outcomes. But when good tooling isn&#8217;t available, it&#8217;s time to build it yourself. It&#8217;s this attitude that lead to my work on <a href="http://cocoadocs.org">CocoaDocs.org</a>, and then to <a href="http://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods.org</a> &amp; its documentation.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been trying to apply this to testing, and in order to pull this off I&#8217;ve had to extend Xcode to show off the results of failing tests in a more visual way. To that end, I&#8217;ve extended Xcode to show the results of failing <a href="https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case">view tests</a> in a more visual way by building <a href="https://github.com/orta/snapshots">Snapshots for Xcode</a>.  Let&#8217;s go through the process of building an Xcode plugin so you can do this too. Screw stability.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>Lets start of with some Xcode inception. The nicest way to start working on Xcode plugins is to install <a href="http://alcatraz.io">Alcatraz</a> the Xcode plugin package manager:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/supermarin/Alcatraz/master/Scripts/install.sh | sh</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>From Alcatraz you should have <a href="https://github.com/edwardaux/XcodeExplorer">XcodeExplorer</a> installed. This lets you dig through internal notifications and the Xcode view heriarchy for debugging. Then you&#8217;ll want <a href="http://delisa.me">Delisa Mason</a>&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/kattrali/Xcode5-Plugin-Template">Xcode 5 Plugin</a> template which also comes from Alcatraz. Now you can create a new project and pick <em>&#8220;Xcode 5 Plugin&#8221;</em>. This will do a bunch of the boring work around getting set up on a project, though it misses one bit that to me is essential, setting the Scheme Target. Once setup go to the Scheme editor and make it open Xcode as the target.</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2014-06-17-building-the-xcode-plugin-snapshots/scheme.png" alt="Go set you target dangit" /></p>

<p>This means that when you do <code>cmd + r</code> on your project it will open a new instance of Xcode with your plugin installed, making the dev cycle for a plugin as simple as a normal OS X app. From here I can&#8217;t tell you how to build your plugin. It&#8217;s just normal development, however I can offer some general advice:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you see a class you don&#8217;t know, google it, chances are Luis Solano has you covered with <a href="https://github.com/luisobo/Xcode-RuntimeHeaders">Xcode-RuntimeHeaders</a>.</li>
<li>Use id with fake class interfaces to get around having the headers for Xcode&#8217;s classes.</li>
<li>Avoid 3rd party dependencies as much as possible as all plugin classes are in the same runtime.</li>
<li>A lot of work is done in notifications, so it&#8217;s easy to hook in to state changes.</li>
<li>Swizzle as little as possible</li>
<li>Wrap code you&#8217;re not 100% on with <code>@try {} @catch {}</code> once it&#8217;s working to crash elegantly</li>
<li>Look at the source code of other plugins</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://github.com/kattrali/Xcode5-Plugin-Template#notes">the notes</a> on the Xcode5 Plugin Template</li>
</ul>


<h2>Releasing</h2>

<p>Next up you want to get it on Alcatraz, this is just a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/supermarin/alcatraz-packages">alcatraz-packages repo</a>, it&#8217;s like the old days of CocoaPods! Then you have a plugin, and people will always be using the master HEAD version of your plugin, so be wary around putting unstable code on that branch.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to forget that if you build apps you have all the tools you need to improve your workflow, one improvement that saves you an hour today could save thousands of human-hours once it&#8217;s out in the community.</p>

    <updated>2014-06-11T10:50:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/06/11/testing-core-data-migrations</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first time I released a patch release for <a href="http://orta.github.io/#folio-header-unit">Artsy Folio</a> it crashed instantly, on every install. Turns out I didn&#8217;t understand Core Data migrations, now a few years on I grok it better but I&#8217;ve still lived with the memories of that dark dark day. Because of this I&#8217;ve had an informal rule of testing migrations with all the old build of Folio <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2013/03/29/musical-chairs/">using chairs</a> the day before submitting to the app store.</p>

<p>This time round, I&#8217;ve made vast changes to the Core Data models but skipped the manual work. Here&#8217;s how:</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Context: Folio is a big Core Data app, that now has hundreds of <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/orta/getting-eigen-out?slide=40">tests</a> that I&#8217;ve added in the past 6 month, tests that cover everything from <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/orta/getting-eigen-out?slide=40">the views</a> to simple model checks. It was originally built with a CoreDataManager singleton that contains a reference to a per-thread main managed object context. As I started to apply tests to the app I needed to start creating in-memory managed object contexts for <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/dependency-injection-ios/">dependency injection</a>. Making my class (roughly) end up like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>This made it very cheap conceptually to make a new in-memory context and to be sure that the changes wouldn&#8217;t affect the development data store. However, once I had this framework in place it became a pretty simple jump to taking the existing sqlite files that I already had around in my <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2013/03/29/musical-chairs/">chairs folder</a> and make to force a migration from that build to the latest managed object model. Here&#8217;s the test suite in full:</p>

<p>Nothing too surprising, but I think this is important that these tests are the slowest tests in the app, at a whopping 0.191 seconds. I&#8217;m very willing to trade a fraction of a second on every test run to know that I&#8217;m not breaking app migrations.</p>

    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/05/12/continuous-integration-for-service-oriented-architectures</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whatever you have against monolithic architectures, at least they&#8217;re easy to test. And when those tests succeed, you can be reasonably confident the live app will work the same way.</p>

<p>Artsy began as one such monolithic app, but we&#8217;ve been refactoring into an ecosystem of related APIs and sites. Today, when you search for <a href="https://artsy.net/gene/cultural-commentary">&#8220;cultural commentary&#8221;</a> or visit <a href="https://artsy.net/artist/robert-longo">Robert Longo</a> on <a href="https://artsy.net">artsy.net</a>, the page is rendered by a web app, sources data from an API, retrieves recommendations from a separate service, tracks trends in another, and records analytics in yet another.</p>

<p>This was a boost for developer productivity and scaling, but eviscerated the value of our tests. We repeatedly encountered bugs that were failings of <em>the interaction between codebases</em> rather than failings of individual ones. Test libraries and tools typically concern themselves with one isolated app. When you have services that consume services that consume services, those isolated tests (with their stubs of everything else) don&#8217;t necessarily reflect production&#8217;s reality.</p>

<p>So how should we develop our small, focused apps (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">service-oriented architecture</a>, or <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">microservices</a>&#8230;) with confidence? We set out to build a dedicated acceptance test suite that would run tests across multiple services, configuring and integrating them in a way that closely matches the production environment.</p>

<h2>The code</h2>

<p>We&#8217;ll take the simplest example possible of 2 related applications: a trivial Ruby API serving a Node.js-based web app. (You can also go directly to <a href="https://github.com/joeyAghion/multiapp_example-tests">the source</a>.)</p>

<p>We&#8217;re using the popular [and familiar] <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a> with <a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec">RSpec</a> and <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>. Naturally, our test fails right away:</p>

<p>There are a few steps to getting our projects installed and running as part of the test suite. First, we&#8217;ll add git submodules in the <code>/api</code> and <code>/web</code> subdirectories that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9189575/git-submodule-tracking-latest">track the master branch</a> of each project.</p>

<p>Next, create Rake tasks to install prerequisites for each project.</p>

<p>The new <code>checkout</code> and <code>install</code> tasks make sure we have the latest code and all prerequisites installed. Note how we use <code>Bundler.with_clean_env</code> to isolate the API (which has its own Gemfile and bundler environment) from the test suite.</p>

<p>Now that the API and web apps are set up, we&#8217;ll use RSpec&#8217;s <code>before(:suite)</code> and <code>after(:suite)</code> hooks to start and stop them around each test run.</p>

<p>The web app isn&#8217;t authenticated to use the API! This brings up a more general question:</p>

<h2>How to bootstrap test data</h2>

<p>Most testing frameworks offer fixtures or direct access to the database. Because the API runs in a separate process, things are a little more difficult. We opt for 1 of 2 approaches, depending on the context:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Insert data directly into the API&#8217;s database.</strong> We tend to do this only as a last resort, because tests would presume knowledge of the API&#8217;s implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Perform test set-up via the API.</strong> Slightly nicer, and closer to real-life clients. (However, the API must be fairly complete.)</li>
</ul>


<p>In practice, we &#8220;cheat&#8221; and use direct database-insertion to initially bootstrap an API client application, then perform further test set-up through the API. You should choose what&#8217;s most convenient.</p>

<p>Our simple example will register the web application as an API client, then pass a key via basic authentication. We&#8217;ll have to modify the <code>start_web</code> helper:</p>

<p>This basic structure has accommodated dozens of test scenarios. We&#8217;ve extended it with database- and cache-clearing between tests, and organized helpers into modules under <code>spec/support</code>. The suite is built nightly against the latest versions of our codebases, and has caught a few significant bugs.</p>

<p>A caveat: with so many layers and dependencies involved, there are often spurious failures. We&#8217;ve picked up a few practices that help:</p>

    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/04/24/generating-notifications-and-personalized-emails-efficiently</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We recently launched a new personalized email here at <a href="https://artsy.net">Artsy</a> that features content that a given user might find interesting. The goal of this post is to describe how we built a backend system that efficiently generates these e-mails for all our users. I&#8217;ll talk about the first, naive implementation that had performance problems right away, and how the second implementation (currently in production) solved those issues, and whose behavior at scale is well-defined and understood. I won&#8217;t go into the details of the design and layout of the mail itself and how we render the content - there are several earlier blog posts that deal with those: <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/03/18/presenters-and-memoization-moving-logic-out-of-templates/">Presenters and Memoization</a>, <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/03/17/ruby-helper-to-group-artworks-into-a-pinterest-style-layout-for-email/">Pinterest-style Layouts</a> and <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/03/17/some-tips-for-email-layout-and-responsiveness/">Email Layouts and Responsiveness</a>.</p>

<h3>Deciding What Content to Include</h3>

<p>First, we had to decide what types of personalized content we wanted to feature in our mails. Users can follow artists and galleries, and so this seemed like a great place to start. We&#8217;d like to let you know about new artworks that have been uploaded by artists that you follow, as well as new shows that have been added by galleries you follow, or that are exhibiting artists you follow. Since we have location data for our galleries and our users (accomplished thru an onboarding flow, or thru geo-locating their IP address), we also want to include new shows that are opening near you. Additionally, we have a recommendations engine that recommends artworks to users based on their preferences and activity on the site, and we&#8217;d like to show some of the latest and best of such recommendations.</p>

<h3>Initial Implementation Ideas</h3>

<p>My first thought was to have an observer (really just some <code>after_save</code> callbacks) that will wait for data to get into a state where a user can be validly notified, and in a background task write these notifications to interested users. Here&#8217;s how the base setup of our <code>Notification</code> model looked:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Notification</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="ss">Mongoid</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Document</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="ss">Mongoid</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Timestamps</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">belongs_to</span> <span class="ss">:user</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">belongs_to</span> <span class="ss">:notifiable</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">polymorphic</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">inverse_of</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">:notifications</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&#8217;s a simple join of the user and the <code>notifiable</code> (the object/action that a user is being notified about).</p>

<p>Then, a specific notification (such as one for published artworks by artists you follow) can inherit from this and look like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">create_for_users</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">artwork</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">uids</span><span class="p">)</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, the <code>after_save</code> hook on an <code>Artwork</code> model is:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">delay_notify</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="no">PublishedArtworkNotification</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">delay</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">queue</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">:any</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">notify!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">published_changed?</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">published</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So, when an artwork is published, we run <code>notify!</code> in the background for the respective notification. That method will pull all interested users (via following the artist), and then spawn off more background processes to write the notifications in batches of 100. We batched these writes to avoid any one background process taking too long (an artist such as <a href="https://artsy.net/artist/andy-warhol">Andy Warhol</a> has around twelve thousand followers currently), and also ran them at a lower priority to avoid blocking other jobs in our queue.</p>

<p>The other types of notifications were all implemented similarly (via an observer on the model, and a specific <code>Notification</code> class inheriting from the base class). We also added some other logic into the base <code>Notification</code> class such as some uniqueness constraints, as well as an ability to mark notifications as &#8216;sent&#8217; or &#8216;invalid&#8217;. However, we ran into serious performance/scaling issues fairly quickly, and had to re-implement this scheme.</p>

<h3>Performance Bottlenecks</h3>

<p>All of these records were being written to one collection in <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, and the size of this collection grew quite rapidly. It&#8217;s size almost immediately dwarfed the size of any of our other collections, and the number of records quickly reached into the tens of millions. This led to problems: writing new notifications started to crawl to a standstill. We had several indices on this collection to aid in querying, and these made the insertion of new notifications very non-performant, and also started to affect overall database performance. Querying against this collection degraded quickly and started to similarly affect database performance. Archiving old records also proved next to impossible. We couldn&#8217;t simply drop the entire collection, but had to prune records. This similarly was totally non-performant and was adversely affecting database and site performance. We needed to come up with a new implementation for <code>Notification</code>, and addressing these issues was essential.</p>

<h3>Resolving Performance Bottlenecks</h3>

<p>So, we decided on a scheme where each day would result in a new <code>Notifications</code> collection (name keyed on the date), named <code>notifications_20140101</code>, <code>notifications_20140102</code>, etc. Each of these collections would have an <code>_id</code> field that corresponds to a user_id, and an <code>events</code> array (or &#8216;stack&#8217; if you will) that records the id&#8217;s of notified objects, as well as the type of notification. An example of a record in that collection is:</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So, here we see all of my notifications for April 22, 2014. On that day, I was notified about 4 shows opening near my location, and one artwork added by an artist I follow. Incidentally, that artwork was a piece by <a href="https://artsy.net/artist/rob-wynne">Rob Wynne</a> entitled <a href="https://artsy.net/artwork/rob-wynne-youre-dreaming">You&#8217;re Dreaming</a>. The show notifications were for NYC-area shows opening at <a href="https://artsy.net/klein-sun-gallery">Klein Sun Gallery</a>, <a href="https://artsy.net/garis-and-hahn">Garis &amp; Hahn</a>, <a href="https://artsy.net/miyako-yoshinaga-gallery">Miyako Yoshinaga Gallery</a> and <a href="https://artsy.net/dodgegallery">DODGEgallery</a>.</p>

<p>A couple of nice things about this implementation is it limits the size of a collection: any one day&#8217;s collection will scale directly with the number of users, which seems reasonable. Our earlier implementation scaled with the product of the number of users and amount of content on Artsy, which is clearly problematic. Also, archiving old notifications is as simple as dropping a particular day&#8217;s collection, which is very performant. However, querying and assembling these notifications is a bit trickier than in the naive implementation, as well as marking which events have already been sent to a user, so as to avoid duplicating any content in between mailings.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see how we rewrite the notification generation in this scheme:</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at what&#8217;s going on here. When an artwork is published, we call <code>notify_many!</code> in the <code>NotificationService</code> module. That will determine the correct collection (keyed by the date) using the <code>collection</code> and <code>collection_name</code> helpers. We build our events stack with the <code>events_from</code> helper, and then do an <code>upsert</code> with a <code>$push</code> to either insert or update that user&#8217;s events for that day. Due to the fast performance of this scheme, we also no longer have to batch notification creation. As a sample benchmark, writing this type of notification to our <a href="https://artsy.net/artist/andy-warhol">Warhol</a> followers takes under 15 seconds.</p>

<p>Ok, so we seem to have solved some of our issues: namely writing and archiving notifications is performant, and we understand the behavior of these collections as the number of users and content on the site grows. Now let&#8217;s look at how we can query against this scheme in an efficient manner, and also how we can mark events as &#8216;seen&#8217; to avoid emailing out duplicates.</p>

<h3>Marking Notifications as Flushed and Retrieving Notifications</h3>

<p>We decided to push a <code>flushed</code> event onto the user&#8217;s stack after we send out notifications, and analogously, when we are querying a user&#8217;s notifications, we want to throw away notifications that occur before a <code>flushed</code> event. Here&#8217;s that method, in our <code>NotificationService</code> module:</p>

<p>Pretty simple. We push the appropriate event onto every collection that was under consideration via the <code>collections_since</code> helper. When we send out a personalized email we accumulate the last 7 day&#8217;s worth of activity for you, and so after we generate/send a mail for a user, we can simply say <code>NotificationService.flush!(user)</code>. Here&#8217;s how that day&#8217;s notifications for me looks after the <code>flushed</code> event:</p>

<p>We introduce a lite-weight <code>Notification</code> class that will load the object, as well as perform an additional check. We use the previously introduced <code>collections_since</code> helper to retrieve all the notification collections under consideration. We query each and build up an array of all events from a user&#8217;s stack. We remove events that occurred prior to a <code>flushed</code> event in a given collection and the <code>flushed</code> events themselves. Then we actually load all the objects and return the ones that are still <code>applicable?</code>. That final <code>applicable?</code> check is to allow us to filter out content at run-time that is no longer valid. For example, if an artwork is published and the correct event is written out to users, but before the user can be notified the artwork is unpublished, this can serve as a run-time check to not include that work. <code>def notifiable?</code> can thus be implemented in the <code>Artwork</code> model like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">notifiable?</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">published?</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And&#8230;that&#8217;s basically it! Throughout the week as partners are uploading their shows/fair booths/artworks, these records are being opportunistically written to that day&#8217;s notification collection, in a performant and scalable fashion. Then when we want to send you a personalized email, we pull all your appropriate notifications via the <code>get</code> routine in our <code>NotificationService</code>, and primarily using the technique described in <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/03/18/presenters-and-memoization-moving-logic-out-of-templates/">Presenters and Memoization</a> we make sure we cache/memoize all such data. Using the tips in <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/03/17/ruby-helper-to-group-artworks-into-a-pinterest-style-layout-for-email/">Pinterest-style Layouts</a> and <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/03/17/some-tips-for-email-layout-and-responsiveness/">Email Layouts and Responsiveness</a> we can render this content and support various devices/email clients. We parallelize and batch the generation/sending of our e-mails as well. This whole system, from notification generation to actually emailing users, is running successfully and smoothly in production.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>I think this type of infrastructure can easily be adapted to serve as a feed on a front-end or other client app. An API to serve up these notifications (AKA feed items) can be built and different feed items can then be rendered or aggregated at load-time. Simple client-side polling can even be set up to alert a user if something has happened that interests them <em>while</em> they&#8217;re browsing! I think push notifications and other messaging can be handled by this system as well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to hear any feedback and thoughts, and hopefully you&#8217;ve found this post informative and interesting. Please leave any feedback in the comments and <a href="https://github.com/artsy">follow us on Github</a>!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Artsy ran several successful auctions over the past few months. The first, <a href="https://artsy.net/feature/two-x-two">TWO x TWO</a>, raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for amfAR (the AIDS Research foundation), and the Dallas Museum of Art. It was followed by <a href="https://artsy.net/feature/ici-benefit-auction">Independent Curators International</a>, at which Artsy launched on-site auction projection screens, which displayed competing bids coming in online from places around the world, like Oslo and Santa Monica, in realtime. Users could place bids on the website, via the iPhone app or with one of the Artsy representatives in the room carrying an iPad.  All the auction lots sold, and Artsy helped ICI to raise 50% more than its target revenue goal. Other, recent Artsy auctions include <a href="https://artsy.net/feature/public-art-fund-2014-spring-benefit">Public Art Fund</a> and the <a href="https://artsy.net/feature/brooklyn-artists-ball">Brooklyn Artists Ball</a>, benefitting the Brooklyn Museum.</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2014-04-17-implementing-bidding-in-an-english-auction-with-mongodb/ici-live-auction.jpg" alt="ICI Auction: Live" /></p>

<p>The domain of auctions is a fascinating one, and includes everything from buying items on eBay to trading livestock and selling investment products on the stock exchange. For those interested in the large spectrum of auctions I highly recommend <a href="http://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~parsons/projects/mech-design/publications/bluffers-final.pdf">Auctions and bidding: A guide for computer
scientists</a> by Simon Parsons (CUNY), Juan A. Rodriguez-Aguilar (CSIC) and Mark Klein (MIT).</p>

<p>At Artsy we implemented a classic English auction with, so called, &#8220;book bids&#8221;. I spent a fair amount of time visiting engineering teams that have built internet auctions, most of which were transactional systems where taking a position on an item involved starting a transaction, running an auction round and committing the changes. In contrast, we chose to deliver a simpler, eventually consistent system on top of MongoDB, in which all data is immutable and where some level of serialization occurs within a single background process.</p>

<p>In this post we&#8217;ll go over some data modeling and examine the auction engine implementation details.</p>

<h3>Data Modeling</h3>

<p>In the Artsy platform, an <em>Auction</em> is an specialization of a more general concept of a <em>Sale</em>. A sale typically has an opening and a closing date, during which bidding or purchases can occur. We create a relationship between an artwork and a sale, which, in the case of an auction, includes the opening bid amount. We store all money in cents, and assume the currency to be USD, making it easy to extend the system for other currencies in the future.</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t just mimic the real world where bidding typically requires registration - the bidder record doesn&#8217;t belong to the user and contains essential data to identify an individual that is placing a bid. It also solves a very peculiar problem where a user decides to delete their account mid-auction. Finally, a bidder could eventually delegate bidding to an agent through this model&#8217;s permissions.</p>

<p>A bidder doesn&#8217;t actually place any bids, but create a <em>Bidder Position</em>, which indicates the highest amount they are willing to pay for a given artwork.</p>

<p>This is called a &#8220;book bid&#8221; - before technology took over the auctions world buyers delegated an agent to bid on their behalf after giving them a maximum amount they were willing to part with. Bidder positions belong to a bidder and to the artwork-to-sale relationship. They cannot be changed - if a user wants to increase his maximum bid, he simply creates a new bidder position.</p>

<h3>Bidding Round</h3>

<p>Every time a bidder position is created, a <em>Bidding Round</em> is queued for the item being bid on. We can parallelize execution of these by artwork, however all bidding rounds for the same artwork are serialized.</p>

<p>One of the interesting aspects of this system is what happens when two users create two identical bidder positions - the earlier one wins and the later one is outbid. In a transactional system we could produce an error message to the second bidder before the position is even created.</p>

<h3>Bidder Notifications</h3>

<p>Notifying upon being &#8220;outbid&#8221; is straightforward, because a position only enters that state once, but notifying bidders of when they are the current high bidder or when their bid has been increased is trickier. We don&#8217;t want to generate notifications every time a bid is made (i.e., it&#8217;s the current high). Rather, we want to allow the round to reach a stable state at which there&#8217;s only a single active position and then notify the current high and outbid bidders. This happens after each <code>round.run!</code>.</p>

<h3>Beyond Bidding</h3>

<p>Aside of the bidding implementation we&#8217;ve built a whole software ecosystem around auctions. We developed a backend system to manage these. We put up projection screens at the event that list works being auctioned and flash every time a bid is placed. We register users&#8217; credit cards and collect their money.</p>

<p>The software part, however, is definitely dwarfed by the amount of logistics and people involved in making one of those auctions a success. We&#8217;re only trying to make that a bit more efficient. We&#8217;ll see you at the upcoming BAM Art Auction, SFMOMA Modern Ball or the Whitney Museum Art Party!</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/04/02/refactoring-infrastructure/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-02T10:32:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/04/02/refactoring-infrastructure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring</a> usually describes chages to <em>code</em>. Specifically, small changes that bring a codebase closer to the desired state. By making these changes incrementally and without modifying the end-to-end behavior, we avoid risk and the intermediate broken states that usually plague large-scale changes. But refactoring need not be limited to code. It&#8217;s also an effective way to make infrastructure improvements.</p>

<p>Take the most common&#8211;and simplest&#8211;example: database schema changes. Environments that demand constant uptime have long had to chunk schema changes into steps that allow for a graceful transition. In the simple case of replacing a column, this might look like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add the new column</li>
<li>Redirect code references there from the old column</li>
<li>Migrate data as necessary, and finally</li>
<li>Remove the old column</li>
</ol>


<p>The same sequencing applies to making larger infrastructure changes gracefully. Some recent examples from our own experience:</p>

<h2>Splitting databases</h2>

<p>When MongoDB&#8217;s <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/faq/concurrency/">database-level write-lock</a> started to impact our API performance, we explored switching certain batch insertions to a separate database. We made the transition seamless by first adding a version number to the batch logic. Existing batches would default to &#8220;v1&#8221; treatment and be read from the main database, while new batches would get &#8220;v2&#8221; treatment and be inserted into (and then read from) a secondary database. (See <a href="https://gist.github.com/joeyAghion/9955727">this gist</a> for a more concrete demonstration.) After a few cycles, legacy collections had all been replaced by more recent batches in the new database and could be removed.</p>

<h2>Extracting a web front-end from a monolithic app</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://artsy.net">artsy.net</a> site was recently extracted from our main Rails application into a dedicated Node.js app and a true client of our API. We rolled it out almost page-by-page; we simply configured <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</a> to proxy requests for a whitelist of paths to the new site. That allowed us to start with the simplest of pages and incorporate new ones as they were developed. Nginx supports <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_pass">sophisticated proxying rules</a>, but our example can be as simple as:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>location ^~ /about|press {
</span><span class='line'>  proxy_pass http://next.artsy.net;
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once the new app was feature-complete, we removed the proxying layer and updated DNS so it would handle all requests.</p>

<h2>New hosting environment</h2>

<p>When we <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2013/08/27/introduction-to-aws-opsworks/">switched hosting providers</a> for our main application, it required changes to <em>many</em> related tools and services (for logs, deploys, background queues, etc.). To mitigate risk, we set up a &#8220;double-deploy&#8221; to the legacy and new environments as soon as the basic elements were in place. The environments ran the same code and shared a data store. First, we targeted the new environment from only a few internal apps. As we surfaced and fixed bugs, we directed more client applications away from the old, eventually winding it down altogether. The process was spread over months, but since each individual change was small and low-risk, we were confident and could adjust course as necessary.</p>

<h2>Full application rewrite</h2>

<p>Occasionally&#8211;but rarely&#8211;it&#8217;s awkward to partially roll out a new system. Maybe it&#8217;s a significant enough re-imagining that it won&#8217;t play nicely with the legacy application (e.g., a clashing UI that&#8217;s difficult to back-port). It&#8217;s <em>still</em> possible to take a refactoring approach. When the new application is minimally viable, new customers can be directed to it. As more customers join and the new application reaches feature parity (and beyond), the user base naturally shifts toward the new and away from the old. Legacy customers can be transitioned when it&#8217;s more convenient.</p>

<p>Trying a refactoring approach over the course of these large infrastructure changes has convinced me of the following lessons:</p>

<p><strong>1. There&#8217;s <em>always</em> a more incremental approach.</strong> Repeat after me.</p>

<p><strong>2. Your culture will benefit.</strong> Just as the tools and vocabulary of code refactoring yield benefits to development workflow, there are cultural benefits to viewing infrastructure as more dynamic and flexible. We&#8217;re able to make more aggressive changes, and with greater confidence in the result. Nothing is sacred, &#8220;fixed,&#8221; or can&#8217;t be undone.</p>

<p><strong>3. Ship sooner.</strong> By exercising the ability to roll out infrastructure changes incrementally, bugs and mistaken assumptions are surfaced earlier.</p>

<p><strong>4. Transitions can be ugly.</strong> There will likely be some embarrassing intermediate stages. Embrace it. As a rule of thumb, it&#8217;s OK to compromise the old system&#8217;s integrity (i.e., <em>hack</em>) to ease the transition as you work toward the new ideal.</p>

<p>The tools for managing infrastructure have been improving steadily (see <a href="http://www.getchef.com/chef/">Chef</a>, <a href="http://www.ansible.com/home">Ansible</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a>), making infrastructure changes more lightweight, testable, and repeatable&#8211;closer to code. Refactoring infrastructure is the natural extension of this. From <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck">Kent Beck</a>:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When dealing with rendering data for an email, one frequently has to make many database calls to assemble the required data. This can be slow, and depending on how you structure the code that is assembling the data vs rendering the data in a template, it&#8217;s very easy to be making repeated calls, which can significantly slow down your process. Additionally, whether you are using <a href="http://haml.info/">Haml</a>, <a href="http://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>, <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a>, or any other templating language, embedding too much logic in the template can making things hard to maintain (especially if some logic lives in the template and some elsewhere in your domain code). Of course some logic in the template (a conditional: should I render this section?, or loops: render this hash of data) is necessary, but I like to keep as much out of there as possible. It&#8217;s easier to optimize, debug and maintain that logic elsewhere, and also writing complex logic in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> is much more fun than in a templating language!</p>

<p>In this article I&#8217;ll present what I&#8217;ve been doing to keep my templates relatively logic-free, and how I make sure I don&#8217;t repeat any heavy database calls in assembling my data.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The Setup - Presenters and Memoization</h2>

<p>First, I&#8217;d like to introduce the Presenter pattern, and how this can help clean up your templates. Here are a couple of links about using presenters with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> that I&#8217;ve found useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2007/03/rails-presenter-pattern.html">Jay Fields&#8217; Guide to Presenters</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mdesjardins/presenters-in-rails">Mike Desjardins&#8217; Slideshare Presentation</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Consider the following screenshot of a section of a weekly email that we send our users:</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2014-03-18-presenters-and-memoization-moving-logic-out-of-templates/recently_added.png" alt="Example of Recently Added Works" /></p>

<p>This section shows works that have been added that week by artists that you follow. That&#8217;s clearly going to involve some database calls, and potentially heavy ones at that. Now we&#8217;d like to accomplish two things here: we want to make sure that we only make these calls once (no matter what we wind up doing with the data later), and we also would like to make sure that any code or logic that is making these calls and doing any data manipulation is not being done directly in our templates. Keeping this kind of logic out of your template will make it easier to debug, maintain and write.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start by creating a Module to hold the various logic required for this email:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">WeeklyEmailPresenter</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="vi">@user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">user</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Ok, so far so good. In our mail template rendering/calling code, we can now say:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="vi">@presenter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">WeeklyEmailPresenter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will allow us to refer to methods in this class in our mail template. So now let&#8217;s add a method that will query our database and return a list of artists that this user should be notified about:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">WeeklyEmailPresenter</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="vi">@user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">user</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">recently_added_works</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1"># Some really heavy database query</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Ok, that was easy. In our HAML template, we can now do:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haml'><span class='line'><span class="p">-</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="vi">@presenter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">recently_added_works</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="vi">@presenter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">recently_added_works</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">any?</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">%table</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">%tr</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nt">%td</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="p">-</span><span class="vi">@presenter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">recently_added_works</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">artists</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'>          &lt;!-- markup to render each artist with recently added works --&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, take a look at how many times we&#8217;ve referred to <code>@presenter.recently_added_works</code> - 3 times already! And we&#8217;ll most likely refer to it more elsewhere (perhaps when deriving a subject line, or showing a total count somewhere, etc.). Depending on how you&#8217;ve implemented the method <code>recently_added_works</code>, you may be re-querying the database every time it&#8217;s referred to! Clearly that&#8217;s a lot of wasted resources. So, let&#8217;s look at an easy change that will guarantee we only ever perform the work to assemble this data once. We memoize it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">WeeklyEmailPresenter</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="vi">@user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">user</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">recently_added_works</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="vi">@recently_added_works</span> <span class="o">||=</span> <span class="n">build_recently_added_works</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">private</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">build_recently_added_works</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1"># Code to do database lookups</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>All we&#8217;re doing is moving the actual code that&#8217;s doing the heavy lifting into a <code>private</code> method (for convention, I like to prefix the name with <code>build_</code>). The public method that we refer to elsewhere in our presenter and template simply calls the appropriate <code>private</code> method. Through using an instance variable combined with conditional assignment, we guarantee that the <code>build_</code> method (our heavy and slow workhorse method) will only be called once, no matter how many times we refer to the public method.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! To summarize, use instance variables in your public methods which is what your templates and other code will use. Those public methods should call private <code>build_</code> methods which actually do all the heavy lifting. This way, you get to easily move logic away from a template and into its own module, and can guarantee that you&#8217;re not repeating any long-running database queries or other slow data processing.</p>

<p>Hopefully you&#8217;ve found this a useful pattern to follow, please leave any feedback in the comments and <a href="https://github.com/artsy">follow us on Github</a>!</p>

<p>Something we&#8217;d like to do is email our users some suggested artworks as part of their personalized emails. The layout of those suggestions should look something like our newly re-designed <a href="https://artsy.net/browse/artworks?price_range=-1%3A1000000000000">Browse</a> page, with a &#8216;salon&#8217; style layout. Here&#8217;s some simple Ruby code that can group artworks into columns for you, that can then be directly rendered in an email (via <a href="http://haml.info/">Haml</a>, <a href="http://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>, <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a>, or your templating language of choice.)</p>

<p>The algorithm is quite simple (original JS idea and implementation courtesy of Artsy&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/gib">Gib</a>). The inputs are fairly obvious, an array of artworks to be grouped, the number of columns to group them into, and the width of each column.</p>

<p>We then simply iterate over all our artworks, and add them to whichever column is shortest. This way we end up with several columns that are for the most part equally sized in height, and as they all have different aspect ratios, when they are rendered in a table, you wind up with a nice looking &#8216;dynamic&#8217; layout. The height of each column is calculated as the sum of the heights of the artworks in each column. The heights are derived from the inputted widths and aspect ratios of the images.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how you might iterate over the returned column groupings and render a layout similar to the above:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>These few lines of Ruby code have allowed us to move logic out of Haml (yuck!) and into Ruby (yay!) and allow <a href="http://haml.info/">Haml</a> to just focus on rendering the objects passed in (certainly via loops and conditionals, etc.)</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now! In my next post I&#8217;ll talk about how I use the Presenter pattern and memoization to move even more logic out of templates (and save some database calls while we&#8217;re at it!)</p>

<p>Thanks again! Post any comments or tips of your own here, and <a href="https://github.com/artsy">follow us on Github</a>!</p>

<p>Email can be one of the most powerful ways to engage with your users, and can serve a multitude of purposes. It can be used as a way to highlight selected content (weekly/monthly newsletters, &#8216;year in review&#8217;, etc.), provide a service to users (analytics breakdown of visits to your profile/favorites page), or re-engage with users (new feature announcements, etc.). Here at Artsy we use all of these kinds of emails and have found them to be a very valuable asset. However, best practices for template layout and CSS (keeping in mind the variety of devices and screen sizes that your users have) are quite different from, and very far behind, the current HTML5 standards and practices for making beautiful web pages. In this article, I&#8217;d like to present some techniques I&#8217;ve successfully used at Artsy to create emails that look good on your browser or mobile device, in some of the most popular email clients out there.</p>

<h2>The Main Difference Between Email and Web</h2>

<p>A fundamental difference between email and web, and which essentially accounts for the completely different methodology and rules you should follow for emails, is that of the rendering client. In 2014, (assuming you are not supporting certain legacy versions of Internet Explorer and other old versions), browsers for the most part will render passed in HTML and CSS in a standard fashion. While there are some notable exceptions still, graceful degradation is quite possible. That is because the only &#8216;interpreter&#8217; of your HTML is the end user&#8217;s browser, which operates under a certain set of known rules. With emails however, the interpreter is the end user&#8217;s mail client of choice, which can be: native iOS apps, web apps, and even standalone desktop applications. All of these do their own parsing/interpreting before rendering, which can cause HTML that results in a nice looking web page to look totally broken in an email, as well as the same exact email looking remarkably different across mail clients. One of the main reasons why email clients do this is to remove things that might interfere with the rendering of the mail client itself, or any security risks.</p>

<p>Also of note is that the use of Javascript within an email is of course, not possible. Additionally, the HTML that will be emailed to your users needs to be sent as one file with inlined CSS. You can use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/premailer/premailer/">premailer</a> to allow you to develop your CSS separately and then convert to an inline style.</p>

<h2>Some Basics about Tables</h2>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s 2014, and yes, we&#8217;re going to talk about tables on an engineering blog. That&#8217;s because for emails, tables are going to be your main tool to position and lay out your content. Two of the most common CSS selectors (<code>position</code> and <code>display</code>) are bad ideas to use in email. They are mostly unsupported by mail clients (which will reach in and rewrite your HTML/CSS) and will lead to unexpected looking output. However, you can achieve virtually any layout desired using tables.</p>

<p>Here is sample HTML that generates the top part of the email shown above. While it may make your eyes bleed from the table use, notice we are able to achieve the beginnings of a basic 3-column layout, with equal-width columns and centered headers/text with no position-related CSS.</p>

<p>Now under this we present a heatmap and table of top views by city. For that we use the same 3-column table, except specify a colspan of 2 on the column that contains the heatmap. That is because we would like that column to take up a width equal to the first 2 columns of the equally spaced three at the top, and the table of top views will take up the last column. Here&#8217;s that markup:</p>

<p>Notice that again we are using no position or display related CSS. However, now our table has a 3 column section and a 2 column section, and we are well on our way to creating a nice email! I kept these as separate rows in the same table, but could have equivalently had each of them be their own table with no ill effects and almost the same markup. Depending on your design and layout, you may need to have multiple tables (nested and not) to support different widths and column layouts, however they should all just <em>work</em>.</p>

<h2>Background Images and Overlayed Text</h2>

<p>Ok, so tables are all well and good and you can achieve a lot using them, and without having to use any display or position CSS. But what if you want to overlay text on an image? (or even another image over an image)? On a web page, there are many ways to accomplish that, but they all use CSS that you really should not be using in emails (namely: <code>position</code>, <code>display</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, and most layout properties besides padding. Also, no negative padding please!). But no worries, because you can still accomplish that using background images!</p>

<p>Here is an example from our current welcome mail to users:</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2014-03-17-some-tips-for-email-layout-and-responsiveness/welcome_desktop.png" alt="Example of Welcome Mail" /></p>

<p>The top part (the iPhone pic) is actually two images (the picture, and the App Store logo), as well as some text overlayed on top. Here is the HTML to accomplish that:</p>

<p>I chose to use a separate table to hold this content, where the background image for this table is the picture of the iPhone in hand. That table (with a background of the photo) has two rows, each with one column. The first row which is for the top part of the image, contains the &#8216;Download&#8217; white text. That is positioned within the column through padding, which is well supported by most mail clients (as long as it&#8217;s positive padding that is!) The second row, for the bottom part of the image, is a picture of the &#8216;Download on the App Store&#8217; logo, and we chose to put that in an anchor tag and link to the App Store. You could have alternatively made this image a background as well to achieve the same overlay effect, as well as added more overlaid text, etc.</p>

<p>Essentially, to overlay text on images, and images on images - your only option in email is to use background images.</p>

<h2>Mobile Responsiveness</h2>

<p>Ok, at this point we know how to craft some &#8216;dynamic&#8217; layouts, (multi-column, sidebar, etc) and can overlay text and images for added effect. Now let&#8217;s think about how this should work/look on a mobile device. Media queries will be our tool of choice here (well supported by mobile mail clients, with a notable exception being the Gmail iOS app.)</p>

<p>Something to keep in mind, depending on your use case, is to potentially design the email in the first place with mobile in mind. This can mean larger font sizes across the layout, as well as a single or two column layout max for your content. Since you have much less screen space to work with on mobile, the media queries we are going to use will largely be to increase font sizes, as well as using &#8216;width&#8217; and &#8216;float&#8217; to force a two column layout into one column (as an example). Depending on the mail design, this can be simple to do, or quite tricky. It&#8217;s worth considering this in your initial designs.</p>

<p>Now the first thing to do is to include the following meta tag in your HTML:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&#39;viewport&#39;</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">&#39;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will tell the browser to treat the viewport size as the size of the device that is being used. This combined with media queries will enable us to create mobile emails.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the following two images. The first is the desktop version of the top part of a personalized weekly mail (blog post on how we efficiently generate these to come!), and the second is the mobile version of that same mail.</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2014-03-17-some-tips-for-email-layout-and-responsiveness/personalized_desktop.png" alt="Example of Personalized Desktop" /></p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2014-03-17-some-tips-for-email-layout-and-responsiveness/personalized_summary.png" alt="Example of Personalized Mobile" /></p>

<p>The markup for this is pretty vanilla (similar to above, 3 column layout in a table). For mobile, we want to left-align everything and trim things down to one column. Of note here is that we are truncating text with ellipsis in the desktop version, and when the content reflows to one column we actually have <em>more</em> room to reveal the text (but still keeping truncation in just in case), so we have to enclose the text in a <code>div</code> (must have a block element for truncation)</p>

<p>Here is how we truncate text:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&#39;row-to-expand&#39;</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&#39;white-space:nowrap;overflow:hidden;text-overflow:ellipsis;width:150px;&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    Some really long text that will get truncated
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We specify a width on a block-level element and then use the ellipsis trick. Here&#8217;s another screenshot of the truncation in action:</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2014-03-17-some-tips-for-email-layout-and-responsiveness/personalized_shows.png" alt="Example of Shows Listing" /></p>

<p> Our first media query can be something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'>  <span class="k">@media</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">max-device-width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">320px</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">div</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="nt">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;row-to-expand&#39;</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">260px</span> <span class="cp">!important</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We&#8217;ve set the breakpoint at 320px (vertical layout on an iPhone), and at widths less than or equal to that, this rule will kick in. Note the &#8216;!important&#8217; at the end (all of our media queries will have that to allow them to override the existing inline CSS). This is enough to expand that div and reveal more text.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the media queries for the rest of this section that transforms the three column layout into one:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>where the <code>td[id='nested-summary-col']</code> are the <code>td</code>s that hold the thumbnail and artist or gallery name.
Essentially all we are doing is changing the width of the container/parent table to 300px, and then making the width of each <code>td</code> 300px and adding a float. This will force your table to now be a one column layout- easy!</p>

<h3>Some misc. email tweaks</h3>

<p>Sometimes it becomes necessary to hide/show certain things for mobile or desktop. This can be a bit tricky due to not being able to use <code>display:none;</code> , so here are a few things I&#8217;ve found that worked:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>width: 0px;</code> (works for hiding images)</li>
<li><code>line-height: 0px;</code> (works for hiding text)</li>
<li><code>font-size: 0px;</code> (works for hiding text)</li>
</ul>


<p>Another thing you might encounter is that text links automatically become blue in email. This is because many mail clients will take an un-styled or black link text and make them a default blue color. An easy hack to get around this is to explicitly color your links something like &#8216;#000001&#8217;. This &#8216;almost-black&#8217; will be left untouched by mail clients, yet is close enough to black that the naked eye can&#8217;t perceive the difference.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of an <a href="https://github.com/desandro/isotope">isotope</a> or <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> column style layout, with truncation of text, and resized for mobile (running the full gamut of tricks):</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2014-03-17-some-tips-for-email-layout-and-responsiveness/personalized_suggestions.png" alt="Example of Personalized Suggestions" /></p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/mzikherman/9610125">Here is a gist</a> I use to prepare artworks for a columnar display like this. You pass in a collection of artworks (where each artwork is arbitrarily sized), and the number of columns and width of the desired output. It will return the artworks grouped into columns that can be directly rendered in an email, while respecting aspect ratios and ensuring the columns are of <em>approximately</em> equal height - resulting in a dynamic feeling layout. For this email, we group this set of artworks into 2 coumns, with each column having a width of 300px (for desktop).</p>

<h2>Great tools to use:</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/premailer/premailer/">Premailer</a> This will enable you to develop CSS in a sane (ie- not inline) way, and then at generation/compile time, inline it for you.</li>
<li><a href="http://litmus.com/">Litmus</a> Using Litmus&#8217;s VM&#8217;s with different OS&#8217;s and mail clients, you can preview how a sample email will look among all sorts of different configurations. I recommend figuring out what mail clients/browsers/OS&#8217;s you want to target and making sure you test all your emails here.</li>
<li><a href="http://haml.info/">Haml</a> (or any templating language of choice). A lot of the blocks of content in our mails are dynamically generated, and Haml&#8217;s conditionals and looping syntax, as well as
Ruby-style string evaluation has proven invaluable.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>That&#8217;s all for now! With a lot of trial and error, I&#8217;ve built up a toolbelt of tricks, techniques and hacks I&#8217;ve been using to develop responsive and pretty emails quickly. I think of the limited set of tools at my disposal as a puzzle with which you can still create great looking and responsive layouts to feature your content.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2014-03-17-detecting-trends-with-forgetsy/monolith.jpg" alt="Armory Trending Screen" /></p>

<p>As part of our partnership with <a href="https://www.thearmoryshow.com/">The New York Armory Show</a> this year, we installed a number of terminals throughout the fair. These screens used our own real-time data to display an ever shifting set of trending artworks, artists, and booths, to the attendees.</p>

<p>Out of this work, we&#8217;ve open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/cavvia/forgetsy">Forgetsy</a>, a lightweight Ruby trending library. Put simply, Forgetsy implements data structures that forget. Loosely based on Bit.ly&#8217;s <a href="http://word.bitly.com/post/41284219720/forget-table">Forget Table</a> concept, Forgetsy uses decaying counters to track temporal trends in categorical distributions.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Anatomy of a Trend</h2>

<p>To clarify the term &#8216;trend&#8217;, let&#8217;s take this graph of cumulative artist searches over time as an example.</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2014-03-17-detecting-trends-with-forgetsy/searches.png" alt="Artist Search Graphs" /></p>

<p>On the left-hand side, we see a steepening gradient (denoted by the dashed lines) for Banksy during his residency in New York (Oct 2013), but in contrast a linear rise in searches for Warhol over the same period. We define a &#8216;trend&#8217; as this rise in the <em>rate</em> of observations of a particular event over a time period, which we&#8217;ll call τ.</p>

<p>In Forgetsy, trends are encapsulated by a construct named <em>delta</em>. A <em>delta</em> consists of two sets of counters, each of which implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay">exponential decay</a> of the following form.</p>

<p><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_t_1%3DX_t_0%5Ctimes%7Be%5E%7B-%5Clambda%5Ctimes%7Bt%7D%7D%7D" alt="Exponential Decay" /></p>

<p>Where the inverse of the decay rate (λ) is the lifetime of an observation in the set, τ. By normalising one set by a set with half the decay rate (or double the lifetime), we obtain a trending score for each category in a distribution. This score expresses the change in the rate of observations of a category over the lifetime of the set, as a proportion in the range [0,1].</p>

<p>Forgetsy removes the need for manually sliding time windows or explicitly maintaining rolling counts, as observations naturally decay away over time. It&#8217;s designed for heavy writes and sparse reads, as it implements decay at read time. Each set is implemented as a <a href="http://redis.io/">redis</a> sorted set, and keys are scrubbed when a count is decayed to near zero, providing storage efficiency.</p>

<p>As a result, Forgetsy handles distributions with up to around 10<sup>6</sup> active categories, receiving hundreds of writes per second, without much fuss.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Take a social network in which users can follow each other. You want to track trending users. You construct a delta with a one week lifetime, to capture trends in your follows data over one week periods:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">follows_delta</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">Forgetsy</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Delta</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;user_follows&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">t</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">week</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The delta consists of two sets of counters indexed by category identifiers. In this example, the identifiers will be user ids. One set decays over the mean lifetime specified by τ, and another set decays over double the lifetime.</p>

<p>You can now add observations to the delta, in the form of follow events. Each time a user follows another, you increment the followed user id. You can also do this retrospectively:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>Providing an explicit date is useful if you are processing data asynchronously. You can also use the <code>incr_by</code> option to increment a counter in batches. You can now consult your follows delta to find your top trending users:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">follows_delta</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fetch</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Will print:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span> <span class="s1">&#39;UserFoo&#39;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">789</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;UserBar&#39;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">367</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Each user is given a dimensionless score in the range [0,1] corresponding to the normalised follows delta over the time period. This expresses the proportion of follows gained by the user over the last week compared to double that lifetime.</p>

<p>Optionally fetch the top <em>n</em> users, or an individual user&#8217;s trending score:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<h2>In the Wild</h2>

<p>In practice, we use linear, weighted combinations of deltas to produce trending scores for any given domain, such as artists. Forgetsy doesn&#8217;t provide a server, but we send events to an rpc service that updates the deltas in a streamed manner. These events might include artist follows, artwork favorites, auction lot sales or individual page views.</p>

<p>One requirement we have is lifetime flexibility. Forgetsy lets us stipulate the trending period τ on a delta by delta basis. This allows us to lower the lifetime significantly in a fair context, in which we track trends over just a few hours, contrasted with a general art market context, in which we&#8217;re interested in trends over weeks and months.</p>

<p>In summary, the delta structures provided by Forgetsy provide you with a simple, scalable, transparent base for a trending algorithm that can be tuned to suit the specific dynamics of the domain in question.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-30T14:42:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/01/30/isolating-spurious-and-nondeterministic-tests</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Testing is a critical part of our workflow at <a href="https://artsy.net">Artsy</a>. It gives us confidence to make regular, aggressive enhancements. But anyone who has worked with a large, complex test suite has struggled with occasional failures that are difficult to reproduce or fix.</p>

<p>These failures might be due to slight timing differences or lack of proper isolation between tests. Integration tests are particularly thorny, since problems can originate not only in application code, but in the browser, testing tools (e.g., <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>), database, network, or external APIs and dependencies.</p>

<h2>The Quarantine</h2>

<p>We&#8217;ve been <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/05/15/how-to-organize-over-3000-rspec-specs-and-retry-test-failures/">automatically retrying failed tests</a>, with some success. However, these problems tend to get worse. (If you have 10 tests that each have a 1% chance of failing, roughly 1 in 10 builds will fail. If you have 50, 4 in 10 builds will fail.)</p>

<p>Martin Fowler offers the most compelling thoughts on this topic in <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/nonDeterminism.html">Eradicating Non-Determinism in Tests</a>. (Read it, really.) He suggests quarantining problematic tests in a separate suite, so they don&#8217;t block the build pipeline.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Setting it up</h2>

<p>This turned out to be pretty easy to set up, using our preferred tools of <a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec">RSpec</a> and <a href="http://travis-ci.com/">Travis</a>. First, tag a problem test with <code>spurious</code>:</p>

<pre><code>it 'performs tricky browser interaction', spurious: true do
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>Your continuous integration script can exclude the tagged tests as follows:</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec rspec --tag ~spurious
</code></pre>

<p>We&#8217;d like to be aware of spurious failures, but not allow them to fail the build. In our app&#8217;s <code>.travis.yml</code> file, this is as simple as adding a script entry that always exits with <code>0</code> status:</p>

<pre><code>language: ruby
rvm:
  - 1.9.3
script:
  - "bundle exec rspec --tag ~spurious"
  - "bundle exec rspec --tag spurious || true"
</code></pre>

<p>We&#8217;ll see any spurious failures in the build&#8217;s output, but our pipeline won&#8217;t be affected.</p>

<h2>Bonus: Limiting quarantined tests</h2>

<p>So, what prevents the quarantine from getting larger and larger, while the test suite gets weaker and weaker? Fowler <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/nonDeterminism.html#Quarantine">recommends</a> enforcing a limit on the number of quarantined tests (e.g., 8).</p>

<p>We can even trigger a build failure if the limit is exceeded. This <code>.travis.yml</code> writes the spurious suite&#8217;s abbreviated output to a file, then asserts that the summary mentions no more than &#8220;8 examples&#8221;:</p>

<pre><code>language: ruby
rvm:
  - 1.9.3
script:
  - "bundle exec rspec --tag ~spurious"
  - "bundle exec rspec --tag spurious --format documentation --format progress --out spurious.out || true"
  - "[[ $(grep -oE '^\d+' spurious.out) -le 8 ]]"
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The quarantine is no excuse to create tests that fail under realistic conditions. It&#8217;s simply a framework for recognizing and, eventually, fixing or eliminating the problematic tests that inevitably crop up in a complex environment.</p>

<p>Hopefully, our experiment is useful to other teams struggling with unreliable builds. Share any feedback in the comments!</p>

    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2013/11/30/rendering-on-the-server-and-client-in-node-dot-js</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-12-18-rendering-on-the-server-and-client-in-node-dot-js/isomorphic.png" alt="Diagram of Shared Server/Client Architecture" /></p>

<p>At Artsy we&#8217;ve been building <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> applications that share code and rendering between the server and browser. We&#8217;ve seen many benefits from this &#8211; pages load faster, we can optimize SEO, developers are more productive, and JavaScript coding is just an overall better experience.</p>

<p>Today we&#8217;re happy to announce <a href="http://ezeljs.com/">Ezel</a>, our open source boilerplate we use to bootstrap our Node projects and the <a href="https://github.com/artsy/benv">various</a> <a href="https://github.com/artsy/backbone-super-sync">node</a> <a href="https://github.com/artsy/sharify">modules</a> that built up to it.</p>

<p>In his article, <a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-JavaScript-future-web-apps/"><em>Isomorphic JavaScript: The Future of Web Apps</em></a>, Spike Brehm from AirBnB describes this growing trend well and we&#8217;re excited to be a part of it. In this article I&#8217;ll tell Artsy&#8217;s story of moving from a single monolithic application to modular <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> apps that run in Node and the browser and consume our external API.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Growing Pains</h2>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-12-18-rendering-on-the-server-and-client-in-node-dot-js/rails-evolution.png" alt="Evolution of Artsy SOA Diagramm" /></p>

<p>Artsy started as a mostly standard <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> app almost three years ago. In these beginnings we were wildly productive and owe a lot of props to this great framework. However as time went on we started to deviate from the conventional Rails path until we were hardly leveraging much Rails at all. To support an early iOS app we used <a href="https://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a> to build an API. While building our API we wrote a lot of client-side JavaScript and soon integrated <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> for organization. Eventually we cleanly separated our project into a single page Backbone app talking to our API all on inside of this original repository.</p>

<p>We knew we were outgrowing this monolithic project because we had some clear problems&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>Slow initial page loads because of lacking server-side rendering. Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2012/improving-performance-twittercom">describes this problem well</a>.</li>
<li>Slow following client-side renders because of downloading large asset packages without clear ways to break them up.</li>
<li>SEO issues like building <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/specification">escaped fragment</a> pages in Ruby on the server while our users saw what JavaScript rendered on the client.</li>
<li>Maintaining duplicated Ruby/JavaScript code such as templates, date libraries, etc.</li>
<li>Very slow and brittle tests. We had a massive integration test suite consisting of over 3000 <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a> tests that took hours to run because we lacked good JavaScript testing tools.</li>
<li>Poor mobile experience from trying to responsively scale down a large single page app with bloated and unused assets.</li>
<li>Slow asset compilation, server boot, and general build times. Productivity suffered greatly as more code was added to the same monolithic project.</li>
</ul>


<h2>There&#8217;s Got to Be a Better Way</h2>

<p>A monolithic app that treats it&#8217;s client-side code as a second class citizen was clearly not going to scale. Our poor mobile web experience was a good candidate to try something new. So we started building a separate mobile optimized website (m.artsy.net).</p>

<p>Some goals became clear:</p>

<ul>
<li>Better client-side tools from JavaScript testing to package managers.</li>
<li>Share rendering code server/client to reduce duplication and optimize initial page load.</li>
<li>Flexibility. We needed a way to divide our app into smaller chunks with smaller asset packages.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Choosing Technology</h2>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-12-18-rendering-on-the-server-and-client-in-node-dot-js/tech.png" alt="Logos of Browserify, Express, and Backbone" /></p>

<p>Node was a clear choice because it made sharing rendering code server/client possible where other languages and frameworks struggle to do so. There were some existing Node projects that accomplish this such as <a href="http://derbyjs.com/">Derby</a> and <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/rendr">Rendr</a>. However, adopting these had challenges of their own including being difficult to integrate with our API, learning unnecessary conventions, or being early prototypes with lacking documentation.</p>

<p>We wanted an approach that breaks our app into smaller, more flexible, pieces. Not all of Artsy needs to be a thick-client app, or even use much client-side JavaScript at all. Adopting an existing solution and combining most of the server and client into a shared abstraction seemed like an unnecessary black box. After trying many other frameworks we found a combination of lower-level tools to be a clear winner.</p>

<p>We open sourced this combination of tools and patterns into <a href="http://ezeljs.com/">Ezel</a>. Ezel is a light-weight boilerplate project using <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> for structure, and <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a> to compose modules that can be shared server/client.</p>

<h2>Sharing and Rendering Server/Client</h2>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-12-18-rendering-on-the-server-and-client-in-node-dot-js/rendering.png" alt="Diagram of Server + Client Render" /></p>

<p>To share rendering code server/client we had to make sure our templates and objects being passed in to them could work the same server/client.</p>

<h3>Sharing Objects (Backbone Models)</h3>

<p><a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a> lets you write modules that can run in Node or the browser. Since Backbone is able to be required on the server out of the box, it&#8217;s easy to write models and collections that can be required on both sides with Browserify. However, there are two main speed bumps in doing this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Backbone uses AJAX for persistence.</p>

<p>We needed a Backbone.sync adapter that makes HTTP requests server-side, so we wrote one and <a href="https://github.com/artsy/backbone-super-sync">it&#8217;s open sourced.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Data from the server needed to be shared in modules that are used server/client.</p>

<p>For instance, our API is an external URL stored in an environment variable. We needed to use this variable in a module that will be required on the server and the client with Browserify. <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#FAQ-bootstrap">Bootstrapping data</a> is a common technique to share data from the server by embedding JavaScript in the initial HTML and exposing that data globally to the client. To avoid exposing globals we open sourced a tiny module called <a href="https://github.com/artsy/sharify">sharify</a>.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Sharing Templates</h3>

<p>Browserify even lets you share non-JavaScript components server/client using <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-browserify#list-of-source-transforms">transforms</a>. To reuse our <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">jade</a> templates server/client it was a simple matter of using the <a href="https://github.com/OliverJAsh/node-jadeify2">jadeify</a> transform.</p>

<h3>All Together Now</h3>

<p>With templates and models require-able server/client, sharing rendering code became much simpler. Below is an example using the same artwork model and detail template server/client.</p>

<h2>Developer Happiness</h2>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-12-18-rendering-on-the-server-and-client-in-node-dot-js/so-much-win.png" alt="Happy Developer Image" /></p>

<p>Not only does sharing code server/client let you easily optimize page rendering for fast page loads, but development becomes a lot nicer because we can reuse server-side JavaScript tools including&#8230;</p>

<h3>Package Managers</h3>

<p>With Browserify we were able to use npm as a package manager for server or client-side dependencies. There are <a href="http://bower.io/">other</a> <a href="http://component.io/">package</a> <a href="http://jamjs.org/">managers</a> for the client-side. However, because we were already using npm (and npm supports git urls), we could usually point to the project hosted on npm or Github without having to fork it.</p>

<p>For projects that don&#8217;t support CommonJS modules (or npm), often one can still use npm and requires like so:</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>Testing is light-years ahead because you can test all of your code in Node headless. I wrote <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2013/06/14/writing-headless-backbone-tests-with-node-dot-js/">an article</a> on this a while back, and now with Browserify it&#8217;s even better.</p>

<p>Models, templates, and other modules that are shared server/client can be required into <a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/">mocha</a> and tested server-side without extra effort. For more view-like client-side code that depends on DOM APIs, pre-rendered HTML, etc., we open sourced a library called <a href="https://github.com/craigspaeth/benv">benv</a> to help build a fake browser environment in Node for testing.</p>

<h3>Modularity</h3>

<p>We wanted to avoid a monolithic organization that groups code by type such as &#8220;stylesheets&#8221;, &#8220;javascripts&#8221;, &#8220;controllers&#8221;, etc.. Not only is this a maintenance problem as it makes boundaries of your app unclear, but it also affects your users because it encourages grouping assets into large monolithic packages that take a long time to download.</p>

<p>Instead, we borrowed a page from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2472984/django-and-project-application-organization">Django</a> and broke up our project into smaller conceptual pieces called &#8220;apps&#8221; (small express sub-applications mounted into the main project) and &#8220;components&#8221; (portions of reusable UI such as a modal widget). This let us easily maintain decoupled segments of our project and build up smaller asset packages through Browserify&#8217;s <code>require</code>s and <a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/docs/import.html">Stylus</a>&#8217; <code>import</code>s. For more details on how this is done please check out <a href="http://ezeljs.com/">Ezel</a>, its <a href="https://github.com/artsy/ezel#project-vs-apps-vs-components">organization</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/artsy/ezel#asset-pipeline">asset pipeline</a> docs.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting, to avoid CSS spaghetti we followed a simple convention of name-spacing all of our classes/ids by the app or component name it was a part of. This was inspired by a <a href="http://philipwalton.com/articles/css-architecture/">blog post from Philip Walton</a>.</p>

<h2>Success!</h2>

<p>With this new architecture and set of Node tools we&#8217;ve seen enormous benefits compared to the pains of developing Backbone in a monolithic project with lacking JavaScript tools. Our mobile web experience is much better, we can render more content on the server for SEO and faster page loads, our test/build/deploy cycles went from hours to minutes, our developer on-boarding time went from days to minutes, and overall developer happiness has significantly improved.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an exciting time to be developing JavaScript apps and we will continue to open source our efforts wherever possible. Thanks and <a href="https://github.com/artsy">follow us on Github</a>!</p>

    <updated>2013-11-07T12:34:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2013/11/07/upgrading-to-mongoid4</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently went through an exercise of upgrading one of Artsy&#8217;s largest web projects to the current HEAD of Mongoid 4.x. This is going to be a major release with numerous changes and I wanted to flush out bugs before the final version of the ODM is released. All Mongoid changes currently live on <a href="https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid">master</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;mongoid&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">github</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;mongoid/mongoid&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the process I&#8217;ve worked on making a few gems compatible with Mongoid 4 and learned a couple of things that should help you make this process smooth for your own applications.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Moped::BSON::ObjectId</h2>

<p>Moped&#8217;s BSON implementation has been removed in favor of the MongoDB bson gem 2.0 and higher. All <code>Moped::BSON</code> references must change to <code>BSON</code>. This is rather annoying and forces many libraries to have to fork behavior at runtime.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Mongoid</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">mongoid3?</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Mongoid</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">const_defined?</span> <span class="ss">:Observer</span> <span class="c1"># deprecated in Mongoid 4.x</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">mongoid2?</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Mongoid</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">const_defined?</span> <span class="ss">:Contexts</span> <span class="c1"># deprecated in Mongoid 3.x</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>mongoid2?</code> implementation is borrowed from <a href="https://github.com/pyromaniac/mongoid_orderable">mongoid_orderable</a> and I wrote the <code>mongoid3?</code> version by parsing the CHANGELOG - observers are deprecated in 4.0.</p>

<p>Now, instead of calling <code>Moped::BSON::ObjectId.legal?(id)</code>, you have to do something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="no">Mongoid</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mongoid3?</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="ss">Moped</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:BSON</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">ObjectId</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">legal?</span> <span class="nb">id</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">else</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="ss">BSON</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:ObjectId</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">legal?</span> <span class="nb">id</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Furthermore, you can no longer convert a string into a <code>Moped::BSON::ObjectId(id)</code>, you must explicitly call <code>from_string</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="no">Mongoid</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mongoid3?</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="ss">Moped</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:BSON</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">ObjectId</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">else</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="ss">BSON</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:ObjectId</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">from_string</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Libraries should then adjust their dependencies on Mongoid and specify <code>&gt;= 3.0</code>, and maybe <code>&lt; 5.0</code>.</p>

<h2>Testing Against Multiple Mongoid Versions</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/pyromaniac/mongoid_orderable">mongoid-orderable</a> gem has a neat system for testing against all versions of Mongoid with <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>. First, the <em>.travis.yml</em> file declares a test matrix that sets <code>MONGOID_VERSION</code>. Note that Mongoid 3.x or newer doesn&#8217;t run with Ruby 1.8.x or 1.9.2.</p>

<h2>Upgrading a Rails Project</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re using Rails, you&#8217;re in for upgrading both Mongoid 4.x and Rails to 4.x. This means you will suffer a lot of pain trying to find compatible versions of various interdependent gems. I suggest locking Rails, Mongoid and ActiveSupport to begin with.</p>

<p>Bulk search &amp; replace <code>Moped::BSON::ObjectId</code> references.</p>

<p>Calls to <code>inc</code>, <code>set</code> and <code>add_to_set</code> now take hashes, eg. <code>artist.inc(likes_count: 1)</code>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re converting Mongoid objects to JSON and seeing data such as <code>{ "$oid" =&gt; "..." }</code> instead of an ID, monkey-patch <code>BSON::ObjectId.as_json</code>. See <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mongoid/MaXFVw7D_4s/T3sl6Flg428J">this discussion thread</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OpsWorks is a new service from Amazon that promises to provide high-level tools to manage your EC2-based deployment. From <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/02/aws-opsworks-flexible-application-management-in-the-cloud.html">the announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>AWS OpsWorks features an integrated management experience for the entire application lifecycle including resource provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, monitoring, and access control. It will work with applications of any level of complexity and is independent of any particular architectural pattern.</p></blockquote>

<p>After scratching our heads about exactly what that meant, we tried it anyway. If you&#8217;ve been straining at the limits of your Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, or just wishing for more automation for your EC2 deployment, you may want to try it out too.</p>

<p>Artsy has been experimenting with OpsWorks for a few months now and recently adopted it for the production <a href="http://artsy.net">artsy.net</a> site. We&#8217;re excited to share what we&#8217;ve learned in the process.</p>

<h2>Why OpsWorks?</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;ve worked with the confusing array of AWS services in the past, you&#8217;re already wondering how OpsWorks fits in. Amazon&#8217;s own <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Elastic Beanstalk</a> or PaaS providers such as <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> typically focus on making your application as simple as possible to deploy. You don&#8217;t have to worry about the underlying hardware or virtual resources; the platform manages that transparently. Dependencies (such as a data-store, cache, or email server) often take the form of external services.</p>

<p>But this simplicity comes at a cost. Your application&#8217;s architecture is constrained to a few common patterns. Your functionality may be limited by the system packages available in the standardized environment, or your performance may be limited by the available resources. OpsWorks offers more flexibility and control, allowing you to customize the types of servers you employ and the layers or services that make up your application. It&#8217;s a lower-level tool than those PaaS providers.</p>

<p>Conversely, OpsWorks offers higher-level control than <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a> or than managing EC2 instances and related services directly. By focusing on the most commonly used AWS services, instance types, and architectures, it can provide greater automation and more robust tools for configuration, authorization, scaling, and monitoring. Amazon CTO <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2013/02/aws-opsworks.html">Werner Vogels</a> rendered it thus:</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-08-27-introduction-to-aws-opsworks/aws_control.png" title="[How OpsWorks fits in AWS offerings]" ></p>

<p>Historically, Artsy delegated dev-ops concerns to Heroku. They worried about infrastructure, freeing us to focus on our application&#8217;s higher-level goals. Increasingly though, we were forced to work around limitations of the platform&#8217;s performance, architecture, and customizability. (We even blogged about it <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/01/31/beyond-heroku-satellite-delayed-job-workers-on-ec2/">here</a>, <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/11/15/how-to-monitor-503s-and-timeout-on-heroku/">here</a>, <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/12/13/beat-heroku-60-seconds-application-boot-timeout-with-a-proxy/">here</a>, <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2013/02/01/master-heroku-command-line-with-heroku-commander/">here</a>, and <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2013/02/17/impact-of-heroku-routing-mesh-and-random-routing/">here</a>.) Rather than continue to work against the platform, we turned to OpsWorks for greater flexibility while keeping administrative burden low.</p>

<h2>OpsWorks Overview</h2>

<p>OpsWorks comes with a new vocabulary. Let&#8217;s look at the major concepts:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em><strong>Stack</strong></em> is the highest-level container. It groups custom configuration and houses one or more applications. To manage a simple to-do list site, you&#8217;d create a <em>todo</em> stack, although you might choose to have separate <em>todo-production</em> and <em>todo-staging</em> stacks.</li>
<li>Each stack has one or more <em><strong>Layers</strong></em>. Think of these as definitions for different server roles. A simple static web site might have a single Nginx layer. A typical web application might instead have a load-balancer layer, a Rails layer, and a MySQL layer. OpsWorks defines plenty of <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workinglayers.html">built-in layers</a> (for Rails, HAProxy, PHP, Node, Memcached, MySQL, etc.), but you can also define your own.</li>
<li><em><strong>Applications</strong></em> are your code, sourced from a git or subversion repository, an S3 bucket, or even an external web site. A typical Rails site might have a single application defined, but you can define multiple applications if you&#8217;d like to configure, scale, and monitor them together.</li>
<li>Finally, we define <em><strong>Instances</strong></em> and assign each to one or more layers. These are the EC2 servers themselves. You can start instances manually, or configure them to start and stop on a schedule or in response to load patterns.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Configuring your stack</h2>

<p>If your app employs a common architecture, you can probably use the OpsWorks dashboard to define layers, add a few instances, link your git repo and be up and running. Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>A static web site hosted on Nginx</li>
<li>A single-server PHP app</li>
<li>A Rails app with an <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/">HAProxy</a> load-balancer, unicorn app servers, and MySQL database</li>
<li>A Node.js app using <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Elastic Load Balancer</a> and a Memcached cache</li>
</ul>


<p>You can find <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/walkthroughs.html">detailed walk-throughs</a> of a few such common use cases in the OpsWorks docs.</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-08-27-introduction-to-aws-opsworks/standard_instances.png" title="[PHP app instances (image from AWS blog)]" ></p>

<p>If the built-in layers don&#8217;t quite satisfy your needs, there are several facilities for customization. But first, it&#8217;s useful to understand how OpsWorks manages your instances.</p>

<h3>Chef cookbooks</h3>

<p>OpsWorks uses <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> to configure EC2 instances. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar, Chef is a popular tool for making server configuration more automated and repeatable&mdash;like code. The Chef &#8220;recipes&#8221; that configure each layer are open-source and available in the <a href="http://github.com/aws/opsworks-cookbooks">opsworks-cookbooks</a> github repo. (Cookbooks contain one or more &#8220;recipes&#8221;&mdash;get it?) There, you can see precisely what commands are run in response to server lifecycle events (i.e., as servers are started, configured, deployed to, and stopped). These recipes write out configuration files, restart services, authorize users for SSH access, ensure logs are rotated, etc.&mdash;everything typical deployments might need.</p>

<p>For example, the recipes that set up an HAProxy instance look like this:</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-08-27-introduction-to-aws-opsworks/haproxy_recipes.png" title="[Built-in recipes for the HAProxy layer]" ></p>

<h3>Overriding configuration &#8220;attributes&#8221;</h3>

<p>Chef cookbooks accept parameters in the form of &#8220;node attributes.&#8221; The default attributes will serve you well in most cases. To override them, edit the stack&#8217;s <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingstacks-json.html"><em>custom Chef JSON</em></a>. For example, to configure Unicorn to run 8 workers instead of 16 and Memcached to bind to port 11212 instead of 11211, you&#8217;d enter the following for your stack&#8217;s custom JSON:</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-08-27-introduction-to-aws-opsworks/custom_json.png" title="'{&#34;rails:&#34; {&#34;max_pool_size&#34;: 8}, &#34;memcached&#34;: {&#34;port&#34;: 11212}}'" alt="'{&#34;rails:&#34; {&#34;max_pool_size&#34;: 8}, &#34;memcached&#34;: {&#34;port&#34;: 11212}}'"></p>

<h3>Custom cookbooks</h3>

<p>If setting node attributes isn&#8217;t sufficient, you can go further and override the files written out by your layer&#8217;s recipes. Simply toggle the <em>Use custom Chef cookbooks</em> option in your stack settings and provide a link to a git, subversion, S3, or HTTP location for your <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-installingcustom-enable.html">custom cookbooks</a>.</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-08-27-introduction-to-aws-opsworks/custom_cookbooks.png" title="[Enabling custom cookbooks]" ></p>

<p>Your custom cookbooks bundle can also contain original or <a href="http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbooks.html">borrowed</a> recipes that perform any other custom configuration. Tell OpsWorks when to run your recipes by associating them with the desired events in your layer settings. For example, we use custom recipes at our Rails layer&#8217;s <em>setup</em> stage to perform additional Nginx configuration, install a JavaScript runtime, and send logs to <a href="https://papertrailapp.com/">Papertrail</a>.</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-08-27-introduction-to-aws-opsworks/custom_recipes.png" title="[custom Chef recipes]" ></p>

<p>OpsWorks shares details about the entire stack with recipes via node attributes, allowing custom recipes to connect to other instances as required.</p>

<h3>Custom layers</h3>

<p>If the built-in layers don&#8217;t satisfy your needs even after customization, you can create custom layers. The base OpsWorks configuration is provided (for SSH authorization, monitoring, etc.) and your custom recipes do the rest. For example, we created a custom layer to process background jobs:</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-08-27-introduction-to-aws-opsworks/custom_layer.png" title="[custom background jobs layer]" ></p>

<p>Down the road, we might introduce additional layers for Redis, Solr, or MongoDB. (Even better, AWS may introduce built-in support for these.)</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>OpsWorks makes most <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html">EC2 instance types</a> available, so we can choose an appropriate balance of CPU power, memory, disk space, network performance, and architecture for each instance. This can be a <em>huge</em> boon to the performance of resource-constrained applications. It probably still pales in comparison to running directly on physical hardware, but this benefit alone could make OpsWorks a worthwhile choice over providers of &#8220;standard&#8221; computing resources.</p>

<p>While not a rigorous comparison, the experience of one of our particularly memory-constrained applications illustrates this. The application&#8217;s responses took an average of 638 milliseconds when running on Heroku&#8217;s <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-size">&#8220;2x&#8221; (1 GB) dynos</a>. The same application responded in only 134 milliseconds on OpsWorks-managed <em>m1.large</em> instances (with 7.5 GB). That&#8217;s a ~80% (5x) improvement!</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-08-27-introduction-to-aws-opsworks/new_relic_comparison.png" title="[OpsWorks performance superimposed on Heroku performance (chart: New Relic)]" ></p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s all well and good, but what about when things <em>aren&#8217;t</em> working?</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve experienced our fair share of failures with both OpsWorks and Heroku. PaaS providers like Heroku offer a pleasant abstraction, but in doing so reduce our visibility into the systems running our application. (Want to know why a dyno seems to be performing poorly? Good luck diagnosing resource contention, disk space problems, or network latency.) Instead, we&#8217;re reduced to repeatedly issuing restart commands.</p>

<p>In contrast, I can easily SSH into an OpsWorks instance and notice that a runaway process has pegged the CPU or that a chatty log has filled the disk. (Of course, the additional control afforded by OpsWorks increases the chance that I&#8217;ve caused the problem myself.)</p>

<p>Which do we prefer? We&#8217;d probably be safer with Heroku&#8217;s experts in charge, but I&#8217;ll happily accept light sysadmin duties in exchange for the flexibility OpsWorks affords. And by sticking with the OpsWorks default recipes as much as possible, we benefit from the platform&#8217;s combined experience.</p>

<h2>Scaling and recovery</h2>

<p>Scalability and recovery are critical, so how does OpsWorks compare to full-featured PaaS providers? Pretty well, actually.</p>

<p>OpsWorks instances can be launched in multiple AWS availability zones for greater redundancy. And if an instance fails for any reason, OpsWorks will stop it and start a new one in its place.</p>

<p>Especially useful is the automatic scaling, which can be time-based or load-based. This nicely matches  the horizontal scaling needs of our app: we&#8217;ve chosen to run additional Rails app servers during peak business hours, and additional background workers when load on existing servers exceeds a certain threshold.</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-08-27-introduction-to-aws-opsworks/time-based_scaling.png" title="[time-based scaling]" ></p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-08-27-introduction-to-aws-opsworks/load-based_scaling.png" title="[load-based scaling]" ></p>

<p>When background workers are busy, new instances spin up automatically to tackle the growing queue. <em>That</em> is dev-ops gold.</p>

<h2>Monitoring</h2>

<p>OpsWorks provides a monitoring view of each stack, with CPU, memory, load, and process statistics aggregated by layer. You can drill down to individual instances and review periods anywhere from 1 hour to 2 weeks long.</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-08-27-introduction-to-aws-opsworks/monitoring.png" title="[OpsWorks monitoring view]" ></p>

<p>We haven&#8217;t tried it, but OpsWorks also offers a built-in <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workinglayers-ganglia.html">Ganglia layer</a> that automatically collects metrics from each of your stack&#8217;s instances.</p>

<p>Conveniently, AWS also sends these metrics to its own <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">CloudWatch</a> monitoring service, where you can configure custom alerts.</p>

<h2>Integration with other AWS services</h2>

<p>You might be noticing a theme here: OpsWorks leverages AWS&#8217;s other tools and services quite a bit.</p>

<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/iam/">Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> allows you to define individual user accounts within an umbrella account for your organization. These users can be authorized for varying levels of access to your OpsWorks stacks. From the <em>Permissions</em> view of each stack, you can then grant them SSH and <em>sudo</em> rights on an individual basis.</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-08-27-introduction-to-aws-opsworks/permissions.png" title="[OpsWorks permissions view]" ></p>

<p>Other tools such as the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2">EC2 Dashboard</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSRubySDK/latest/frames.html">AWS API</a> work as you&#8217;d hope, with all of the usual functions being applicable to your OpsWorks-managed instances and other services like elastic IPs and EBS volumes.</p>

<h2>Cost</h2>

<p>Pricing is simple and enticing. There&#8217;s no charge for using OpsWorks; you pay only for your underlying usage of other AWS resources like EC2 instances, S3 storage, bandwidth, elastic IPs, etc. If you&#8217;ve purchased <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/reserved-instances/">reserved instances</a>, those savings will apply as usual.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, OpsWorks doesn&#8217;t yet support <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/">spot instances</a> (but I imagine that&#8217;s in the works).</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>In the few months since its launch, OpsWorks has added support for <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">ELB</a>, monitoring, custom AMIs, and more recent versions of Chef and Ruby. There&#8217;s also an <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=153">active discussion forum</a> where developers and Amazon employees circulate issues and request features. It&#8217;s a relatively new service and can occasionally be rough around the edges, but&#8211;knowing AWS&#8211;we expect the current pace of enhancements to continue.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve already launched one major app on OpsWorks and will be looking for more opportunities as it gains a following and grows in sophistication.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A whopping 49% of Artsy users have &#8220;gmail.com&#8221; email addresses. The next domain name, &#8220;hotmail.com&#8221;, doesn&#8217;t even come close, with only 6%.</p>

<p><img src="http://artsy.github.io/images/2013-06-23-normalizing-gmail-email-addresses-with-canonical-emails/artsy-email-domains.png" /></p>

<p>GMail addresses ignore periods and are case-insensitive. For example, &#8220;Donald.Duck@gmail.com&#8221; and &#8220;donaldduck@gmail.com&#8221; are the same account. You can log-in to GMail with both. Users often register with the former and try to log-in to Artsy with the latter. With so many GMail users, expect a dozen support emails per day.</p>

<p>The solution is to normalize these emails into a canonical form.</p>

<p>It would be great to see contributions to our gem if you have knowledge of special handling with other email providers!</p>

<p>On the application side, Artsy stores both the original email address entered by the user and the canonical representation and perform all lookups by the canonical value.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Artsy website, Partner CMS, mobile tools, and all our hackathon experiments are built on top of a core API. We&#8217;ve put a lot of effort into documenting it internally. But developers don&#8217;t want to have to grok through code. With <a href="https://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a> and <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger">Swagger</a>, adding an API explorer and exposing the API documentation has never been easier.</p>

<h3>Cross Origin Requests</h3>

<p>You don&#8217;t need to include the API explorer into your application. Instead, enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) with <a href="https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors">rack-cors</a>.</p>

<p>Your application will now respond to <code>OPTIONS</code> and <code>GET</code> requests with CORS headers. It&#8217;s also important to verify that errors still contain CORS headers, as shown in these RSpec tests.</p>
