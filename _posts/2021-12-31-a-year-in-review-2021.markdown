Wow - what a year! Here are some notable achievements, failures, and learnings from Artsy Engineering in 2021...

<!-- more -->

## Success!

- Leveraged our investment in React Native to launch our Android App: Props to David, Mounir, Pavlos, Joanna, and the Collector Experience team
- Moved X% of Force apps to V2 and Y% of Force traffic: Props to Chris, Damon, (...)
- We killed X repos and retired N services
- The awards for fastest PR from start date goes to: A! And even better, Ole did his first PR to Artsy 3 months before he joined.
- We started and released N episodes of the Artsy Engineering Radio
- We onboarded 23 engineers in Berlin - Props to Adam B, Christian and a whole team of willing mentors
- Took down our poor CWV url numbers by 876786% (not verified)
- Design system and Palette docs
- Migrated Force and Eigen to new design system
- Rebuilt the inquiry flow! Finally!
- Migrated to a new ESP without incident (described as a project “i wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy”)
- Hiring and investing a lot in turn-key set-up for new folks
- New capabilities to our ecommerce functionality – ARTA, Avalara, Make Offer in Inquiries
- Hired Luis, our first agile coach!
- Collaborated with N iTechArt engineers on impactful projects
- Moved a bunch of projects off of Heroku and onto our Kubernetes infrastructure
- Spun up new collector-facing integrations: Algolia, Adjust, Braze, Split IO, Postie
- Tech leads are taking more ownership over the success of their teams
- Integrated our API with more 3rd party art management systems: ArtBase, Artsystems
- Trialed integration with Split, experimentation and feature flagging vendor
- Moved a bunch of pages in force to palette v3
- More teams with focused goals
- We opened 12,425 PRs
- Responded to and resolved (N) incidents
- After many false starts, we finally agreed to pull the trigger on a full bidding engine rewrite
- More stable end-to-end automated testing (Integrity)
- Worked with an external company for QA - Applause
- Built a new data team from scratch
- First new recommendation model built in a while - affinity score
- Developed an in-house auction results pipeline
- Made improvements in recommendations (New Works for You) for the first time in a while!
- Migrated X repos to continuously deploy - Props to the Platform team
- N questions answered in our #dev-help slack channel to help get each other unstuck!

## Failures too!

- We had X incidents
- Codecov exploit nightmare and (maybe?) process/tool improvements that it inspired
- Released an app that defaulted to staging :grimace: improved our app QA process in response
- number of PRs that were reverted after deploy (if that's an easy number to gather -- the point being, we break some eggs along the way)

## More learnings?

- 3rd party integrations always take longer than you expect
- Has the SDL (software development lifecycle) made engineers dependent on design specs?
