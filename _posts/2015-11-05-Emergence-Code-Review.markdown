We released the fourth app from the mobile team, [Emergence](https://github.com/artsy/Emergence/), on day one for the new Apple TV and are currently getting around 2k downloads a day. The codebase was created by a single developer, and we didn't want to keep that knowledge siloed. So, I ran an hour long code review session last night where I talked through the codebase, explained why some decisions were made and about the differences between tvOS and UIKit.

Given that I had been asked to write a blog post about tvOS in general, I felt that making the code review public for anyone to watch would be a nice alternative to the usual long-form writing on this blog.
