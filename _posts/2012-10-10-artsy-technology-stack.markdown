The public launch of Artsy via the
[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is-mapping-the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html)
is a good opportunity to describe our current technology stack.

What you see when you go to [Artsy](http://artsy.net) is a website built with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)
and written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). It renders JSON data from
[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [Ruby Grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape) and
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) services. Text search is powered by [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/). We
also have an [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action) application that talks to the same
back-end Ruby API. We run all our web processes on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) and all job queues on
[Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/). Our data store is [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), operated by
[MongoHQ](https://mongohq.com/) and we have some [Redis](http://redis.io/) instances. Our assets, including images,
are served from [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) via the [CloudFront CDN](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).
We heavily rely on [Memcached](http://memcached.org/) Heroku addon and we use [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com/) and
[MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/) to send e-mail. Systems are monitored by a combination of
[New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) and [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/). All of this is built, tested and
deployed with [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/).

In this post I'll go in depth in our current system architecture and tell you the story about how these parts all
came together.

## Early Prototypes

Artsy early prototypes in 2010 consisted of a combination of PHP and Java web services running on JBoss and backed
by a MySQL database. The system had more similarities with a large transactional banking application than a
consumer website.

In early 2011 we rebooted the project on Ruby on Rails. RDBMS storage was replaced with NoSQL MongoDB. A
[video](http://www.10gen.com/presentations/MongoNYC-2012/Using-MongoDB-to-Build-Artsy) was recorded at MongoNYC
2012 that goes in depth into this specific choice.

## Artsy Architecture Today

Having only a handful of engineers, our goal has always been to keep the number of moving parts to an absolute
minimum. With a few new engineers we were able to expand things a bit.

## Artsy Website Front-End

The Artsy website is a responsive [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) application written in
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and served from a Rails back-end. The
generated JavaScript and CSS files are packaged and compressed with
[Jammit](http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/) and deployed to Amazon S3. The Rails app itself is a traditional
MVC system that bootstraps application data and mostly serves SEO needs, such as meta tags, escaped fragments and
page titles. Once the basic data has been rendered though, Backbone routing takes over and you're now navigating a
client-side browser app with pushState support as available, swapping frames and rendering views using JST
templates and JSON data returned from the API.

## Core API

The website talks to the nervous system of Artsy, a RESTful API built in Ruby and
[Grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape).

In the early days we did a ton of domain-driven design and spent a lot of time modeling concepts such as _artist_
or _artwork_. The API has read and write behavior for all our domain concepts. Probably 70% of it is pure CRUD
doing [Mongoid](http://mongoid.org/) queries with a layer of access control in
[CanCan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan) and cache partitioning and binding using
[Garner](http://confreaks.com/videos/986-goruco2012-from-zero-to-api-cache-w-grape-mongodb-in-10-minutes).

## Search Autocomplete

The first iteration of the website's text search was powered by
[mongoid_fulltext](https://github.com/artsy/mongoid_fulltext). Today we run an
[Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) leader-follower environment hosted on EC2.

## Offline Indexes

The indexes that serve complex queries like related artists/artworks and filtered searches of artworks are all
built offline. Our index-building system runs continuously, repeatedly pulling data from our production system to
build the most out-of-date index. All of the most current indexes are imported back into production by a daily
batch process and we swap the old indexes out atomically using
[mongoid_collection_snapshot](https://github.com/aaw/mongoid_collection_snapshot).

One of such indexes a _similarity graph_ that we query to produce most similar results on the website, other
indexes serve filtering needs, etc. We run these processes nightly.

## Admin Back-End and Partner CMS

The Artsy CMS and the Admin system are two newer projects and serve the needs of our partners and our internal
back-end needs, respectively. These are built on a thin [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) server that proxies requests
to our API using [node-http-proxy](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy). They consist of a client-side
Backbone.js application with assets packaged with [nap](https://github.com/craigspaeth/nap). This is a lot like our
website, but completely decoupled from the main Rails application and sharing the same technology for both client
and server with CoffeeScript and [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/).

## Folio Partner App

Artsy makes a free iOS application, called [Folio](http://artsy.github.com/blog/categories/ios/), which lets our
partners display their inventory at art fairs.

Folio is a native iOS implementation. The interface is heavily skinned UIKit with CoreData for storage. Our network
code was originally a thin layer on top of NSURLConnection, but for our forthcoming update, we’ve rewritten it to
use [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/). We manage external dependencies with
[CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods).
