  - title: rspec-rerun
    description:
      The rspec-rerun gem is a drop-in solution to retry (rerun) failed RSpec examples. It may be useful, for
      example, with finicky Capybara tests. The strategy to rerun failed specs is to output a file called
      `rspec.failures` that contains a list of failed examples and to feed that file back to RSpec via `-e`.

  - title: mongoid-fulltext
    description:
      A Ruby full-text search implementation for the Mongoid ODM. MongoDB currently has no native full-text search
      capabilities, so this gem is a good fit for cases where you want something a little less than a full-blown
      indexing service like Solr. The mongoid_fulltext gem lets you do a fuzzy string search across relatively
      short strings, which makes it good for populating autocomplete boxes based on the display names of your Rails
      models but not appropriate for, say, indexing hundreds of thousands of HTML documents.

  - title: mongoid-cached-json
    description:
      Typical as_json definitions may involve lots of database point queries and method calls. When returning
      collections of objects, a single call may yield hundreds of database queries that can take seconds. This
      library mitigates the problem by implementing a module called CachedJson. CachedJson enables returning
      multiple JSON formats from a single class and provides some rules for returning embedded or referenced data.
      It then uses a scheme where fragments of JSON are cached for a particular (class, id) pair containing only
      the data that doesn't involve references/embedded documents. To get the full JSON for an instance, CachedJson
      will combine fragments of JSON from the instance with fragments representing the JSON for its references. In
      the best case, when all of these fragments are cached, this falls through to a few cache lookups followed by
      a couple Ruby hash merges to create the JSON. Using Mongoid::CachedJson we were able to cut our JSON API
      average response time by about a factor of 10.
